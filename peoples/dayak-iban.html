            <h2>Who Are the Dayak Iban?</h2>
            <p>The Iban are the largest Dayak (indigenous Bornean) ethnic group, numbering approximately **1.5 million people**, primarily in the Malaysian state of Sarawak, with smaller populations in Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo) and Brunei. Known historically as "Sea Dayaks" due to their rivers being highways of movement, the Iban developed a distinctive culture centered on **longhouse** communal living, rice cultivation, and—until the early 20th century—**headhunting**. Their elaborate oral literature (pengap), textiles (pua kumbu), and tattooing traditions represent some of Southeast Asia's richest indigenous heritage. Despite dramatic social change, the Iban maintain strong cultural identity while participating fully in modern Malaysian society.</p>

            <h2>Longhouse Life</h2>
            <p>The **longhouse** (rumah panjai) defines Iban social organization—a single massive structure housing an entire community of related families, sometimes stretching over 200 meters along a riverbank. Each family occupies a **bilik** (apartment) opening onto a common covered gallery (ruai) that serves as social space for communal activities, ceremonies, and receiving guests. Longhouses traditionally housed 20-100 families (sometimes more), with a headman (tuai rumah) providing leadership. This communal living fostered strong social cohesion, collective decision-making, and shared labor for rice cultivation. While many Iban now live in modern housing, longhouses remain important—some communities maintain traditional structures, others build modern longhouse-style dwellings, and the concept continues to shape Iban identity. Visitors to Sarawak can stay in longhouses through cultural tourism programs.</p>

            <h2>Headhunting and Warrior Culture</h2>
            <p>Iban society traditionally valorized the **warrior** who proved courage through headhunting raids against enemy communities. Heads were not trophies of random violence but spiritually charged objects believed to bring fertility, protection, and prosperity to the community. Young men gained status through successful raids; heads were ceremonially welcomed and preserved in the longhouse. Elaborate rituals accompanied warfare, including dream interpretation, bird augury, and shamanic blessing. British colonial rule suppressed headhunting from the 1840s, with the practice largely ending by the 1930s—though it briefly revived during World War II when Iban served as scouts and guerrillas against Japanese occupation. Today, antique skulls remain in some longhouses as sacred heirlooms, but warrior values have been redirected toward education, careers, and community leadership.</p>

            <h2>Pua Kumbu: Sacred Textiles</h2>
            <p>Iban **pua kumbu** are sacred ceremonial blankets woven using an ikat technique where threads are tie-dyed before weaving to create patterns. These textiles are more than decorative—they are spiritually powerful objects used in rituals including receiving trophy heads, healing ceremonies, and funerals. Traditional patterns carry cosmological meanings, depicting spirits, ancestors, and mythological narratives. Master weavers underwent spiritual training, receiving designs in dreams. Pua kumbu production declined through the 20th century but has experienced revival as both living tradition and collectible art. Museums worldwide hold important Iban textile collections. Contemporary Iban artists also practice elaborate **hand-tapped tattooing** (traditionally marking achievements and spiritual protection) though this too declined before recent revival. These textile and body art traditions represent sophisticated aesthetic systems developed over centuries.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Iban Society</h2>
            <p>Today's Iban are educated, urbanized, and globally connected while maintaining cultural identity. Many have moved to cities for education and employment; Iban hold positions throughout Malaysian society including professionals, politicians, and academics. Christianity (particularly Anglicanism and Catholicism) has largely replaced traditional religion, though many Christian Iban incorporate customary practices. The **Gawai Dayak** festival (June 1-2) celebrating the rice harvest has become Sarawak's signature cultural event. However, challenges persist: land rights face pressure from logging and palm oil plantations; younger generations may lose proficiency in Iban language and traditional knowledge; and economic development in Sarawak often bypasses rural Iban communities. Activists advocate for native customary rights, language preservation, and sustainable development that respects Iban interests. The Iban demonstrate how indigenous peoples can maintain distinctive culture while engaging fully with national and global modernity.</p>
