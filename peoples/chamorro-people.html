            <h2>Who Are the Chamorro?</h2>
            <p>The Chamorro (CHamoru) are the indigenous people of the Mariana Islands—Guam (US territory) and the Northern Mariana Islands (US commonwealth). They number approximately 150,000—65,000 in Guam (37% of island population), 15,000 in Northern Marianas, and 70,000 in the US mainland (especially California). They speak Chamorro, an Austronesian language with significant Spanish influence. The Chamorro were among the first Pacific Islanders encountered by Europeans (Magellan, 1521) and endured brutal Spanish colonization that reduced their population by 90%+. Today, Chamorro navigate between cultural revival and American integration as a colonial-era population seeking recognition.</p>

            <h2>Ancient Seafarers</h2>
            <p>Chamorro ancestors settled the Marianas around 2000-1500 BCE—among the earliest long-distance oceanic voyagers. They developed distinctive culture: latte stone (megalithic pillars for houses), sophisticated navigation, and stratified society (chamorri nobility, manachang commoners). The flying proa (outrigger canoe) enabled inter-island travel. Society was matrilineal; women held significant power. Spanish contact (1521) brought early trade; Ferdinand Magellan was killed in the Philippines shortly after leaving the Marianas. Spanish missionaries and soldiers arrived in 1668, beginning colonization that would devastate Chamorro society.</p>

            <h2>Colonial Devastation</h2>
            <p>The Spanish-Chamorro Wars (1672-1695) and introduced diseases reduced the Chamorro population from 40,000-100,000 to fewer than 4,000. Spanish colonial policy concentrated survivors in villages, suppressed traditional practices, and imposed Catholicism. Chamorro culture transformed—Spanish language, Catholic faith, and Hispanic customs integrated deeply. After the Spanish-American War (1898), the US took Guam; Germany, then Japan, controlled the Northern Marianas. WWII brought Japanese occupation of Guam (1941-1944) with forced labor and atrocities; the US recapture devastated the island. The US has maintained control since, with massive military presence.</p>

            <h2>American Era</h2>
            <p>Guam became unincorporated US territory; Chamorros became US nationals (1950), then US citizens (with limited rights—no presidential vote, non-voting delegate). The Northern Marianas became US commonwealth (1978) with closer ties but similar limitations. US military installations cover 27% of Guam; the island serves as "tip of the spear" for Pacific strategy. Military expansion plans have sparked Chamorro resistance. Political status debates continue—some seek statehood, others closer ties, some independence. Chamorro remain colonial subjects within the US system, seeking self-determination without clear path forward.</p>

            <h2>Cultural Revival</h2>
            <p>Despite colonial devastation, Chamorro identity persists and revives. The language—endangered by English dominance—has revitalization programs. Cultural practices—inafa'maolek (interdependence), respect for elders, communal fiestas—continue. Traditional navigation knowledge is being recovered. The chamorro.com movement documents culture; festivals celebrate heritage. Catholicism, deeply integrated into Chamorro identity, structures community life. Chamorro serve in US military at high rates. The tension between American integration and indigenous identity, between military presence and self-determination, shapes Chamorro experience. How they achieve political recognition and cultural continuity defines this ancient Pacific people's future.</p>
