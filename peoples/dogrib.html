            <h2>Who Are the Tłı̨chǫ?</h2>
            <p>The **Tłı̨chǫ** (pronounced roughly "Tlee-cho"), historically known as Dogrib, are a Dene (Athabascan) people inhabiting the boreal forest and tundra regions between Great Slave Lake and Great Bear Lake in Canada's Northwest Territories. Numbering approximately **3,500 people**, they are one of the largest Dene groups. The Tłı̨chǫ achieved landmark recognition in 2003 with the **Tłı̨chǫ Agreement**—the first combined land, resources, and self-government agreement in the Northwest Territories, establishing them as a self-governing Indigenous nation. Their name in their own language means "people of the edge of the treeline," reflecting their traditional territory at the transition between forest and tundra, following **caribou** migrations across this vast landscape.</p>

            <h2>Caribou and Traditional Life</h2>
            <p>Like other Dene peoples, the Tłı̨chǫ traditionally followed the **barren-ground caribou** (Rangifer tarandus), whose migrations structured the annual cycle. Bands traveled light, using **birchbark canoes** in summer and **snowshoes** and **toboggans** in winter, camping at fishing lakes and caribou crossings. Caribou provided meat, hides for clothing and shelter, sinew for cordage, and bone for tools. Fish—particularly lake trout, whitefish, and pike—supplemented the diet. Small family groups came together seasonally for caribou hunts and celebrations, dispersing in smaller units during harsh winters. Knowledge of the land—where to find caribou, where ice was safe, which plants healed—was survival itself, transmitted through generations of close observation and oral tradition.</p>

            <h2>The Tłı̨chǫ Agreement</h2>
            <p>The **2003 Tłı̨chǫ Agreement** represents one of Canada's most comprehensive Indigenous self-government arrangements. It established the Tłı̨chǫ Government with law-making authority over citizens and land; confirmed ownership of 39,000 km² of land (including subsurface resources); recognized Tłı̨chǫ as official language alongside English and French; and established a Tłı̨chǫ Community Services Agency for social programs. The agreement emerged from decades of negotiation following the 1993 Nunavut agreement (which separated Inuit territory) and the 1994 Sahtu agreement. The Tłı̨chǫ model has influenced subsequent Indigenous governance negotiations across Canada, demonstrating that comprehensive self-government agreements are achievable. Implementation continues, with the Tłı̨chǫ Government developing capacity while balancing traditional practices with modern governance.</p>

            <h2>Language and Cultural Revitalization</h2>
            <p>The **Tłı̨chǫ Yatıì** language remains relatively healthy, with approximately 2,800 speakers—one of Canada's stronger Indigenous languages. However, English dominance in media and education threatens transmission to younger generations. The Tłı̨chǫ Government runs language programs, and schools in the four Tłı̨chǫ communities (Behchokǫ̀, Whatì, Gamètì, and Wekweètì) offer Tłı̨chǫ instruction. Cultural programs take youth onto the land for traditional activities—hunting, fishing, trapping, and learning bush skills. Elders' knowledge is documented through oral history projects. The **hand games** (a traditional gambling game with singing) remain popular social events. Annual gatherings celebrate Tłı̨chǫ culture while addressing contemporary community issues. The challenge is ensuring cultural continuity as communities become more connected to the broader Canadian society.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Challenges</h2>
            <p>The Tłı̨chǫ face challenges common to northern Indigenous communities: **climate change** affects ice roads, wildlife patterns, and permafrost; the **diamond mining** industry (three major mines operate near Tłı̨chǫ territory) brings economic opportunity but also environmental and social impacts; caribou herds have declined dramatically, affecting both subsistence and cultural practices; and youth face pressures from broader society while opportunities in remote communities remain limited. The Tłı̨chǫ Government works to balance development and protection, negotiating with mining companies while asserting jurisdiction over lands and resources. Self-government provides tools that most Indigenous communities lack, but using them effectively requires building institutions, training people, and navigating complex relationships with federal and territorial governments. The Tłı̨chǫ experience offers lessons for Indigenous self-determination worldwide.</p>
