            <h2>Who Are the Havasupai?</h2>
            <p>The Havasupai, whose name means "People of the Blue-Green Water," are a Native American tribe who have lived in the Grand Canyon for over 800 years. Their remote village of Supai, located at the bottom of Havasu Canyon, is the most isolated community in the contiguous United States, accessible only by foot, mule, or helicopter—there are no roads.</p>
            <p>Today, approximately 730 tribal members live in and around Supai village, which sits 3,000 feet below the canyon rim. The tribe is famous for the stunning Havasu Falls and the series of turquoise waterfalls that cascade through their homeland, colored by high concentrations of calcium carbonate and magnesium in the water.</p>

            </div>

            <h2>Life in the Canyon</h2>
            <p>Supai village is one of the most unique communities in America. Mail arrives by mule train—the last place in the United States where the U.S. Postal Service delivers by pack animal. All supplies, from food to building materials, must be hiked, flown, or packed in. The village has a post office, school, café, general store, and clinic, but no banks or gas stations.</p>
            <p>The tribe practices a blend of traditional and modern lifestyles. While satellite internet and cell phones have arrived, traditional crafts, ceremonies, and language preservation remain important. The Havasupai language, part of the Yuman language family, is spoken by most tribal elders and is being taught to younger generations.</p>

            <h2>The Sacred Waterfalls</h2>
            <p>Five major waterfalls grace Havasupai territory: Fifty Foot Falls, Navajo Falls, Havasu Falls, Mooney Falls, and Beaver Falls. The stunning turquoise-blue color of the water results from limestone deposits. Havasu Falls, a 90-foot cascade into an aquamarine pool, has become one of the most photographed waterfalls in the world.</p>
            <p>These waterfalls and the creek itself hold deep spiritual significance for the Havasupai. Traditional stories tell of a time when the canyon was carved by a great flood and the people were guided to this sheltered homeland. The springs and waterfalls are considered sacred gifts that sustain the community.</p>

            <h2>Tourism and Economy</h2>
            <p>Tourism has become the primary economy for the Havasupai. The tribe operates a campground and lodge, requiring advance reservations and permits for the popular hiking destination. Revenue from tourism supports tribal services, but the influx of visitors also creates challenges for the small, isolated community.</p>
            <p>In August 2008, a massive flood devastated the waterfalls and campground, temporarily reshaping the landscape and requiring extensive recovery. Climate change and extreme weather events pose ongoing threats to the fragile canyon environment and the community's infrastructure.</p>

            <h2>Land Rights and Conservation</h2>
            <p>Historically, the Havasupai ranged over millions of acres, wintering in the canyon and summering on the plateau above. U.S. government policies confined them to a small reservation at the canyon bottom in 1882. After decades of advocacy, the tribe regained 185,000 acres in 1975, though this remains far less than their traditional territory.</p>
            <p>The Havasupai have opposed uranium mining and other development near the Grand Canyon that could contaminate their water sources. They work with conservation organizations to protect the watershed while maintaining their sovereign right to manage their land according to traditional values.</p>
