            <h2>Who Are the Yokuts?</h2>
            <p>The Yokuts are a group of indigenous peoples who traditionally inhabited California's San Joaquin Valley and the western foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains. Before contact, the Yokuts were among the most numerous peoples in California, with populations estimated at 50,000-70,000 individuals organized into approximately 60 distinct tribelets, each with its own territory and leadership. They spoke closely related languages of the Yokutsan family, part of the broader Penutian grouping. Today, several Yokuts tribes are federally recognized, including the Tachi-Yokut Tribe, Tule River Indian Tribe, and Table Mountain Rancheria, with combined populations of approximately 2,000-3,000 enrolled members.</p>

            <h2>Valley and Foothill Life</h2>
            <p>Traditional Yokuts inhabited two distinct ecological zones: the vast floor of the San Joaquin Valley with its marshes, lakes, and grasslands, and the oak-studded foothills of the Sierra Nevada. Valley groups relied heavily on fishing (salmon, sturgeon, and other species), waterfowl hunting, and gathering tule reeds for basketry and shelter construction. Foothill groups emphasized acorn harvesting and deer hunting. All Yokuts processed acorns as a dietary staple, developing sophisticated techniques for leaching out bitter tannins. Villages were organized around family groups, with round earth-covered houses for winter and lighter shade structures for summer. The central valley's abundant resources supported relatively dense populations before European colonization.</p>

            <h2>Basket Weaving</h2>
            <p>Yokuts basket weaving represents one of California's finest craft traditions. Women created coiled baskets of exceptional technical and artistic quality, using willow, sedge root, and redbud materials. Baskets served utilitarian purposes—food gathering, processing, storage, and cooking—as well as ceremonial and exchange functions. Distinctive Yokuts patterns included the "rattlesnake" design and other geometric motifs passed through generations. Basket-making knowledge declined dramatically during the colonial period but never entirely disappeared. Contemporary Yokuts weavers have revived and continue the tradition, producing both traditional and innovative works that are collected by museums and individuals as fine art.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Yokuts</h2>
            <p>Modern Yokuts communities are concentrated on several reservations and rancherias in the southern San Joaquin Valley and Sierra foothills. Economic development includes the Tachi Palace Casino and Hotel, operated by the Santa Rosa Rancheria Tachi-Yokut Tribe, which provides employment and revenue. The Tule River Tribe manages lands including significant forest resources. Cultural revitalization efforts focus on language preservation—Yokuts languages are critically endangered, with few fluent speakers remaining—and the continuation of basketry, ceremonial traditions, and environmental stewardship. The central valley that was Yokuts homeland has been transformed into one of the world's most productive agricultural regions, but Yokuts communities persist, maintaining identity and pursuing economic and cultural self-determination.</p>
