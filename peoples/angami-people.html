            <h2>Who Are the Angami?</h2>
            <p>The Angami are a Tibeto-Burman ethnic group and one of the major Naga tribes of Nagaland, India, numbering approximately 150,000-180,000. They speak Angami (Tenyidie), a Tibeto-Burman language that serves as a lingua franca among several Naga tribes. The Angami inhabit the Kohima district, where the state capital is located, as well as parts of Dimapur. They are renowned for their sophisticated terraced agriculture, stone monuments, and resistance to British colonialism. The Battle of Kohima (1944), a turning point of World War II in Asia, was fought in Angami territory. Most Angami are now Christians.</p>

            <h2>Terrace Agriculture</h2>
            <p>The Angami developed sophisticated wet rice terracing that ranks among the most impressive traditional agricultural systems in South Asia. Carved into steep hillsides, these terraces feature complex irrigation channels directing water from springs through successive fields. The technology allows intensive rice cultivation in terrain otherwise unsuitable for wet rice. Some terraces have been maintained for centuries. Angami villages often controlled specific terrace systems, with water rights carefully managed. This agricultural sophistication supported relatively dense populations and village-based political organization. The terraces remain in use, though labor-intensive maintenance challenges younger generations.</p>

            <h2>British Resistance</h2>
            <p>The Angami fiercely resisted British colonial expansion into the Naga Hills. The Anglo-Angami conflict (1879-1880) saw Angami warriors defend their territory against British forces in one of the most sustained resistances in northeast India. Though eventually subdued, the Angami earned British respect for their martial abilities. Kohima was established as a colonial administrative center in Angami territory. During World War II, Japanese forces attempted to capture Kohima in their invasion of India; the Battle of Kohima (1944) was fought partly in an Angami village. This history of resistance shapes Angami identity and the broader Naga nationalist movement.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Angami</h2>
            <p>Modern Angami enjoy certain advantages from having the state capital in their territory. Kohima's growth has brought economic opportunities in government, commerce, and services. The Angami have produced numerous political leaders, administrators, and professionals. Sekrenyi, the harvest festival, remains an important cultural celebration, adapted to Christian contexts. The Angami language serves as a regional lingua franca. Challenges include balancing traditional terrace agriculture with modern livelihoods, urban-rural disparities, and maintaining cultural traditions. How the Angami leverage their central location, educational attainment, and historical legacy shapes their trajectory as Nagaland modernizes.</p>
