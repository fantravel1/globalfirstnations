            <h2>Who Are the Koraga?</h2>
            <p>The Koraga are a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) of coastal Karnataka (Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts), India, numbering approximately 15,000-20,000. They speak Koraga, a Dravidian language related to Tulu and Kannada. The Koraga are believed to be among the original inhabitants of Tulunad (the Tulu-speaking coastal region) before the arrival of other communities. Historically subjected to extreme social discrimination and forced labor, the Koraga occupied one of the lowest positions in the regional caste hierarchy. Their traditional occupations included basket weaving, mat making, and agricultural labor. Despite legal protections, the Koraga remain among Karnataka's most marginalized communities.</p>

            <h2>Historical Bondage</h2>
            <p>The Koraga's historical experience was shaped by extreme oppression within the Tulunad social system. They were subjected to practices similar to slavery—forced to work without payment for landlords, forbidden from owning land, required to perform the most degrading tasks. They lived in segregated settlements at the margins of villages, facing severe restrictions on movement, dress, and social interaction. These practices, though illegal since Indian independence, left lasting impacts. The Koraga were largely landless, uneducated, and economically dependent on dominant castes. Their traditional craft skills—basket making, mat weaving—provided meager income. This historical marginalization created persistent poverty and social exclusion.</p>

            <h2>Traditional Culture</h2>
            <p>Despite oppression, the Koraga maintained distinctive cultural traditions. Their basket and mat weaving skills were highly valued—Koraga-made items were essential for agriculture and household use throughout the region. They developed their own religious traditions, worshipping deities distinct from those of dominant Hindu society, with their own priests and rituals. The Koraga practiced unique forms of spirit possession ceremonies. Their oral traditions included songs, stories, and ritual texts. The Koraga language, while related to Tulu, is distinct enough that speakers are not mutually intelligible. These cultural elements provided identity and community cohesion despite external oppression.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Koraga</h2>
            <p>Modern Koraga face the legacy of historical discrimination while working toward improvement. Government programs designating them as a PVTG provide some support—housing, education incentives, land grants. However, implementation is uneven and centuries of marginalization are not quickly overcome. Literacy and education levels, while improving, remain below state averages. Many Koraga continue as agricultural laborers or depend on traditional crafts with declining markets. Some have achieved education and professional employment, providing community role models. Cultural programs work to document and preserve language and traditions. The Koraga situation illustrates how indigenous and marginalized communities in India continue struggling against historical injustice while seeking paths to empowerment.</p>
