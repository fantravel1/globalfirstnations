            <h2>Who Are the Ket?</h2>
            <p>The Ket are a small indigenous people inhabiting the middle Yenisei River basin in Central Siberia, Russia. What makes them extraordinary is their language: Ket is the last surviving member of the Yeniseian language family, completely unrelated to any other Siberian tongue and possibly connected to the Na-Dene languages of North America. With fewer than 200 fluent speakers remaining, the Ket represent a living link to deep human prehistory, their language preserving grammatical structures that may date back to the original peopling of the Americas.</p>

            <h2>The Mystery of Ket Language</h2>
            <p>For centuries, linguists puzzled over Ket, unable to connect it to any known language family. In 2008, Edward Vajda demonstrated a connection between Ket and Na-Dene languages (including Navajo and Tlingit), suggesting that ancestors of both groups once lived in Siberia before some crossed to America. This "Dene-Yeniseian" hypothesis revolutionized understanding of human migration, implying that the Ket descend from populations who stayed behind while relatives crossed Beringia.</p>
            <p>Ket grammar is extraordinarily complex, with verbs that can contain up to eight morphemes encoding subject, object, tense, aspect, and other categories. The language uses tonal distinctions (rare in Siberia), gender classes, and elaborate verb conjugations that encode spatial relationships with remarkable precision. This complexity makes Ket extremely difficult to learn and contributes to its endangered status.</p>

            <h2>Traditional Life on the Yenisei</h2>
            <p>The Ket traditionally lived as semi-nomadic hunter-fisher-gatherers along the Yenisei and its tributaries. Summer brought fishing camps along riverbanks, where families caught sturgeon, salmon, and other species using nets, traps, and spears. Autumn meant hunting expeditions into the taiga for elk, reindeer, and fur-bearing animals whose pelts entered the Russian fur trade. Winter found extended families in semi-permanent settlements.</p>
            <p>Unlike neighboring peoples who adopted reindeer herding, the Ket remained hunters who used dogs for transportation and hunting. Their material culture included birch-bark canoes, portable conical tents, and distinctive shamanic regalia. Elaborate wood carving decorated everyday objects, and the Ket developed sophisticated technology for surviving taiga winters reaching -50°C.</p>

            <h2>Shamanism and Cosmology</h2>
            <p>Ket shamanism was renowned throughout Siberia for its power and sophistication. Shamans wore elaborate costumes representing the cosmos, with the shaman's body serving as an axis between upper, middle, and lower worlds. Drums served as vehicles for spiritual journeys, and shamanic séances could last for days. The Ket believed in multiple souls that could become detached, requiring shamanic intervention to restore health.</p>
            <p>The Ket cosmos was divided into seven heavens above and seven underworld layers below, with the earth in between. The supreme god Es created the world and maintained cosmic order, while other spirits inhabited every aspect of nature. Bears held special sacred status, and elaborate rituals governed bear hunting and consumption. This complex cosmology was encoded in myths that shamans preserved and transmitted.</p>

            <h2>Soviet Transformation</h2>
            <p>The Soviet period devastated Ket culture. Collectivization disrupted seasonal migration patterns and traditional economies. Children were removed to boarding schools where speaking Ket was punished, breaking intergenerational language transmission. Shamanism was suppressed, shamans persecuted, and sacred objects destroyed or confiscated for museums. Populations were consolidated into settlements, mixing Ket with larger ethnic groups.</p>
            <p>By the Soviet collapse, the Ket were a marginalized minority struggling with alcoholism, unemployment, and cultural loss. Most Ket spoke Russian as their primary language, and traditional skills were fading. Yet elders retained knowledge, and the post-Soviet era brought new interest in cultural preservation.</p>

            <h2>Endangered Heritage</h2>
            <p>Today, the Ket language is critically endangered. Most fluent speakers are elderly, and transmission to children has largely ceased. Linguists race to document the language before the last speakers pass, creating dictionaries, grammars, and recorded archives. The Dene-Yeniseian connection has brought international attention, with scholars from both Siberia and North America collaborating on research and preservation.</p>
            <p>Revitalization efforts face immense challenges. The small population, geographic dispersion, economic marginalization, and lack of Ket-language education and media all work against language survival. Yet some young Ket are learning from grandparents, and digital tools may help preserve and teach the language. Whether Ket survives as a living language or becomes a documented memory depends on efforts in the coming decades.</p>
