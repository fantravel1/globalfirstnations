            <h2>Who Are the Ogoni?</h2>
            <p>The Ogoni are an indigenous people of Rivers State in Nigeria's Niger Delta, inhabiting a relatively small but densely populated territory of approximately 1,000 square kilometers. Numbering approximately 500,000-850,000 people, they speak several related languages (Khana, Gokana, Baan, and Eleme) of the Cross River branch of Benue-Congo languages. Though small in comparison to Nigeria's major ethnic groups, the Ogoni gained international prominence through their environmental and human rights struggle against Shell Oil and the Nigerian government in the 1990s. The execution of writer Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni activists in 1995 made the Ogoni cause a global symbol of indigenous resistance to extractive industry destruction.</p>

            <h2>Traditional Life</h2>
            <p>Traditional Ogoni economy combined farming and fishing in the delta environment. The relatively fertile upland areas of Ogoniland supported yam, cassava, and vegetable cultivation. Fishing in creeks and rivers provided protein. Trade connected Ogoni with neighboring groups. Social organization was based on clans and villages, with elders playing key roles in governance. Religious life centered on nature spirits and ancestral veneration; sacred groves and shrines dotted the landscape. This relatively self-sufficient economy was transformed by oil discovery in the late 1950s—Shell-BP began extraction in Ogoniland in 1958, initiating decades of environmental degradation that would fundamentally alter Ogoni life and catalyze political mobilization.</p>

            <h2>Ken Saro-Wiwa and MOSOP</h2>
            <p>The Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), founded in 1990 under Ken Saro-Wiwa's leadership, articulated Ogoni demands for environmental remediation, political autonomy, and fair compensation for oil extraction. The Ogoni Bill of Rights (1990) declared Ogoni political autonomy and demanded resource control. Massive demonstrations in 1993 forced Shell to withdraw from Ogoniland. The military government responded with brutal repression; soldiers killed and displaced thousands. In 1995, Saro-Wiwa and eight other leaders were executed after a widely condemned show trial, provoking international outrage, sanctions, and Nigeria's suspension from the Commonwealth. The Ogoni struggle became a landmark case connecting indigenous rights, environmental justice, and corporate accountability.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Ogoni</h2>
            <p>Modern Ogoni continue seeking justice for decades of oil pollution and human rights violations. Shell has never returned to active extraction in Ogoniland, though contamination remains. A 2011 UN Environment Programme report documented extensive pollution requiring remediation costing over $1 billion. Cleanup began in 2019 but proceeds slowly. Some compensation has been paid to affected communities. Political organization continues through MOSOP and other groups. Young Ogoni face limited economic opportunities in the degraded environment; many have migrated to cities. The memory of Saro-Wiwa and the nine martyrs remains powerful, commemorated annually. The Ogoni case established precedents for indigenous peoples confronting extractive industries and remains a reference point for environmental justice movements globally.</p>
