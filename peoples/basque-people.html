            <h2>Who Are the Basque?</h2>
            <p>The Basque (Euskaldunak) are an indigenous people inhabiting the Basque Country (Euskal Herria) spanning northeastern Spain and southwestern France along the western Pyrenees and Bay of Biscay coast. Numbering approximately 3 million in the region (with diaspora worldwide), they speak Euskara (Basque), a language isolate with no known relatives—the only pre-Indo-European language surviving in Western Europe. This linguistic uniqueness suggests the Basque descend from populations predating Indo-European migrations some 4,000 years ago. Genetic studies confirm their distinctiveness. The Basque have maintained their language and identity through Roman, Visigothic, Moorish, and modern Spanish and French rule, making them Europe's oldest continuously surviving indigenous people.</p>

            <h2>Language and Mystery</h2>
            <p>Euskara is Europe's linguistic mystery—an agglutinative language with complex verb morphology, unrelated to any known language family. Attempts to link it to Iberian, Caucasian, or other languages have failed. Its survival while surrounded by Romance languages for 2,000 years is remarkable. Euskara has several dialects, historically quite divergent, now unified in Batua (standardized Basque). The language was suppressed under Franco's dictatorship (1939-1975); speaking Basque in public was punished. Since Spain's democratization, Basque has official status in the Spanish Basque Country; education in Basque (ikastolak schools) has revitalized the language among younger generations. In France, Basque has less official support but cultural promotion continues. Approximately 750,000 speak Euskara fluently.</p>

            <h2>Culture and Traditions</h2>
            <p>Basque culture is distinctive within Europe. Traditional sports include pelota (jai alai), stone lifting (harrijasotzea), wood chopping, and ox-pulling competitions—tests of rural strength. The bertsolari tradition of improvised sung poetry remains vibrant. Basque cuisine is internationally renowned, particularly the pintxos (tapas) of San Sebastián and traditional dishes like bacalao (salt cod). The txalaparta (wooden percussion instrument) and trikitixa (accordion) accompany traditional music. Traditional dress includes the beret, now a Basque symbol worldwide. The Basque Country industrialized early, with shipbuilding, steel, and banking; Bilbao's Guggenheim Museum symbolizes contemporary reinvention. The strong tradition of cooperativism produced Mondragon, one of the world's largest worker-owned cooperatives.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Basque</h2>
            <p>Modern Basque identity navigates between cultural revival and political complexity. The Spanish Basque Country (Euskadi) has extensive autonomy, including its own police, education system, and tax collection. The militant separatist group ETA (1959-2018) killed over 800 people in its campaign for independence; its dissolution ended decades of violence. Political parties span from conservatives supporting autonomy within Spain to leftist independentists. In France, Basque identity strengthens despite limited political recognition. Basque language and culture are thriving—youth fluency has increased dramatically since Franco's era. The Basque diaspora, particularly in Latin America (Argentina, Chile, Mexico) and the American West (sheepherding communities), maintains connections to the homeland. The Basque demonstrate how pre-Indo-European identity can persist and flourish in modern Europe, neither fully absorbed nor politically separated.</p>
