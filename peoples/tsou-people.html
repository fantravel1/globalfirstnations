            <h2>Who Are the Tsou?</h2>
            <p>The Tsou (鄒族, Cou) are an indigenous people of central Taiwan's Alishan (Ali Mountain) region, numbering approximately 6,600-7,000 people. They speak Tsou, a Formosan language of the Austronesian family representing a distinct branch. The Tsou traditionally inhabited the high mountain region of Chiayi and Nantou counties, including the famous Alishan scenic area. Their society was organized around the hosa (village confederacy), with the kuba (men's meeting house) serving as the political, ceremonial, and social center. The Tsou maintained strong warrior traditions and elaborate ceremonial life, including the important Mayasvi war ceremony.</p>

            <h2>The Kuba</h2>
            <p>The kuba (men's meeting house) is central to Tsou social and ceremonial life. These large, distinctive structures served as centers for male gatherings, ceremonies, decision-making, and warfare preparation. Young men received education and training in the kuba. Sacred objects and weapons were stored there. The kuba's architecture—a large thatched structure raised on posts—represented the hosa (village confederacy) it served. Only major villages had kuba, which thus defined political organization. While the kuba's functions have changed, traditional structures have been preserved or reconstructed, and the institution remains symbolically significant for Tsou identity.</p>

            <h2>Mayasvi Ceremony</h2>
            <p>The Mayasvi is the Tsou's most important ceremony, traditionally performed after successful warfare or hunting but now held annually. This war festival honors the war god and ancestral spirits. The ceremony involves complex rituals at the kuba, including songs, dances, and offerings. Traditionally, the heads taken in warfare figured in the ceremony—reflecting the headhunting practice shared with other Taiwanese indigenous groups. With the suppression of headhunting, the ceremony adapted to celebrate Tsou identity without actual heads. The Mayasvi has become a major cultural event, drawing visitors and reinforcing Tsou ethnic consciousness.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Tsou</h2>
            <p>Modern Tsou face the challenges of a small population in a famous tourist destination. The Alishan Forest Railway and mountain scenery draw many visitors, creating opportunities but also development pressures. Tea and bamboo cultivation provide income. Tsou villages near Alishan have developed cultural tourism, but commercial development sometimes conflicts with traditional life. The Tsou language is endangered with few young fluent speakers. Cultural revitalization efforts focus on the kuba, ceremonies, and language. Some Tsou have achieved national recognition in sports and the arts. How this small population maintains cultural distinctiveness in a heavily touristed environment shapes the Tsou's future as keepers of the kuba tradition.</p>
