            <h2>Who Are the Hadza?</h2>
            <p>The Hadza (Hadzabe) are one of the last remaining hunter-gatherer peoples in Africa, numbering approximately 1,200-1,400 people near Lake Eyasi in northern Tanzania. Of these, perhaps 300-400 still practice traditional foraging as their primary subsistence. The Hadza speak Hadzane, a language with click consonants that, despite superficial similarity to Khoisan languages, is considered a language isolate—unrelated to any other known language. Genetic studies suggest the Hadza may represent one of the oldest lineages of modern humans, with deep roots in East Africa stretching back tens of thousands of years. Their continued foraging lifestyle makes them invaluable for understanding human evolution and adaptation.</p>

            <h2>Ancient Way of Life</h2>
            <p>The Hadza represent a window into humanity's longest-practiced lifestyle—hunting and gathering, which sustained humans for over 95% of our species' history. Hadza men hunt with bows and arrows, pursuing baboons, antelope, and other game. They also collect honey, considered a prized food. Women gather tubers, berries, and baobab fruit. This sexual division of labor, common among foraging peoples, provides dietary diversity and risk management. The Hadza maintain remarkable egalitarianism: no formal leaders, no wealth accumulation, decisions made by consensus. Food is shared widely; successful hunters distribute meat throughout the camp. This social organization likely reflects ancestral human patterns. The Hadza demonstrate that hunter-gatherer life is not merely survival but a sophisticated, sustainable adaptation.</p>

            <h2>Scientific Significance</h2>
            <p>The Hadza have attracted intense scientific interest as one of the few remaining foraging populations. Studies of Hadza diet, activity patterns, microbiome, social organization, and genetics inform understanding of human evolution and health. Research shows Hadza walk farther daily than most Westerners, yet have lower rates of heart disease and diabetes. Their gut microbiomes differ markedly from agricultural peoples, possibly protective against certain diseases. Studies of Hadza sharing behavior illuminate the evolution of human cooperation. However, this scientific attention raises ethical concerns: are researchers benefiting while Hadza needs go unmet? Recent collaborations have emphasized community benefit and Hadza involvement in research design. The Hadza have become important voices in discussions about indigenous rights and ethical research.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Hadza</h2>
            <p>Modern Hadza face severe pressure on their land and lifestyle. Pastoral and agricultural peoples have encroached on traditional territories; game populations have declined; water sources have been appropriated. Government settlement schemes have repeatedly attempted to convert Hadza to farming, with limited success—many Hadza who settle eventually return to foraging. Tourism provides income but can be intrusive and disruptive. In recent decades, Hadza communities have gained legal recognition of some traditional lands, a significant victory. The Hadza language remains healthy among those practicing traditional life but is endangered as younger people adopt Swahili. The Hadza face the challenge of maintaining their way of life while their land base shrinks. Their persistence demonstrates both the resilience of foraging adaptation and the urgent need for protection of remaining hunter-gatherer territories.</p>
