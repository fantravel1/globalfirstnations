            <h2>Who Are the Wolof?</h2>
            <p>The Wolof are the largest ethnic group in Senegal and a significant population in The Gambia and Mauritania, numbering approximately 6-7 million people. They speak Wolof, an Atlantic language of the Niger-Congo family that has become the lingua franca of Senegal, spoken by roughly 80% of the population regardless of ethnicity. The Wolof founded the medieval Jolof Empire (c. 1350-1549), which united much of Senegambia before fragmenting into successor states including Cayor, Baol, and Walo. Wolof culture, particularly urban Dakar culture, has become synonymous with Senegalese national identity, influencing fashion, music, and social norms across the country.</p>

            <h2>Caste System</h2>
            <p>Wolof society traditionally organized around a complex caste system. The géer (freeborn) included nobles, warriors, and farmers. Below them were the nyenyo (artisan castes): tëgg (blacksmiths), uude (leatherworkers), gewel (griots/praise-singers), and others, each with hereditary occupations and distinct social positions. Griots held special status as oral historians, musicians, and mediators. At the bottom were formerly enslaved groups. While formal caste obligations have weakened, caste consciousness persists—marriages between castes remain somewhat uncommon, and griots still perform traditional roles. Understanding this system is essential for comprehending Wolof social dynamics and West African stratification patterns.</p>

            <h2>Teranga and Social Values</h2>
            <p>Teranga (hospitality) is considered the defining Wolof and Senegalese value—hosts are expected to share whatever they have with guests, even at personal sacrifice. This ethos extends beyond literal hospitality to generosity, warmth, and social solidarity. Related values include kersa (respect, discretion), jom (dignity, honor), and muñ (patience, endurance). These concepts shape social interactions, conflict resolution, and community life. The elaborate tea ceremony (ataya), involving three successive rounds of increasingly sweet tea shared with guests over hours of conversation, embodies teranga principles. These values have helped maintain social cohesion amid economic challenges.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Wolof</h2>
            <p>Modern Wolof dominate Senegalese urban life, particularly in Dakar, one of Africa's most vibrant cities. Wolof language has spread as urban migration brings diverse ethnic groups together, with most Senegalese now speaking Wolof regardless of background. Wolof culture heavily influences Senegalese music (mbalax), fashion (including elaborate boubous and the famous Dakar style), and popular culture. The Mouride Sufi brotherhood, predominantly Wolof, wields significant religious, economic, and political influence. Wolof entrepreneurs drive commerce, including the famous Mouride trading networks extending globally. As Senegal's dominant culture, Wolof navigate between celebrating heritage and fostering inclusive national identity.</p>
