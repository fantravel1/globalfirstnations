            <h2>Who Are the Chinook?</h2>
            <p>The Chinook are a group of indigenous peoples of the lower Columbia River region in present-day Washington and Oregon. The Chinook Indian Nation (unrecognized federally) claims approximately 3,200 members, while related groups are enrolled in the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde, Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribe, and others. They spoke Chinookan languages, now extinct as first languages, though Chinook Jargon—the trade pidgin they helped create—was once spoken by over 100,000 people across the Pacific Northwest. The Chinook were master traders who controlled Columbia River commerce, greeting Lewis and Clark (1805) and becoming vital intermediaries in the early fur trade.</p>

            <h2>River Traders</h2>
            <p>The Chinook occupied strategic position at the Columbia River mouth, controlling trade between coast and interior. Salmon runs provided abundant food; The Dalles (upriver) was one of North America's largest trade centers. Chinook traded dried salmon, shells, and coastal products for interior goods—a sophisticated commerce network spanning hundreds of miles. They developed Chinook Jargon, a pidgin combining Chinookan, Nootkan, and eventually French and English words, enabling communication across language barriers. This trade language spread from Alaska to California, persisting into the 20th century. Chinook commercial acumen impressed and benefited early European traders.</p>

            <h2>Lewis and Clark Contact</h2>
            <p>The Corps of Discovery wintered near Chinook territory (1805-1806), providing detailed descriptions. Lewis and Clark noted Chinook wealth, trade networks, and head-flattening practice (a mark of high status). Early relations were commercial; the Chinook became essential fur trade partners. But colonization devastated: the "Great Mortality" (1830s)—malaria epidemics—killed perhaps 90% of lower Columbia peoples. Survivors scattered; some joined other tribes, others remained on diminished territory. No treaty was ever ratified with the Chinook despite negotiations. Their strategic location became their loss—prime agricultural and commercial land attracted settlers who displaced surviving communities.</p>

            <h2>Federal Recognition Struggle</h2>
            <p>The Chinook Indian Nation's fight for federal recognition is one of the longest in US history. The tribe organized formally in 1925; recognition petitions have been pending for decades. In 2001, the Bureau of Indian Affairs recognized the Chinook—then reversed itself in 2002 under political pressure, claiming insufficient evidence of continuous community. This devastating reversal left the tribe without federal services, land, or legal standing. Legislative recognition attempts have repeatedly failed. The Chinook remain one of the most historically significant unrecognized tribes, their recognition denied despite documented continuous existence and treaty negotiations.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Chinook</h2>
            <p>Modern Chinook maintain cultural identity without federal recognition. The Chinook Indian Nation operates from Bay Center, Washington, providing services without federal support. Language revitalization efforts work with limited historical materials—no fluent speakers remain. Cultural programs maintain traditions; salmon remains spiritually and practically important. Some Chinook are enrolled in federally recognized tribes (Grand Ronde, Shoalwater Bay); others identify solely as Chinook. The recognition struggle continues—recent legislation has failed but efforts persist. How the Chinook achieve recognition, preserve culture, and maintain community without federal support shapes this trading people's uncertain future at the mouth of the Columbia.</p>
