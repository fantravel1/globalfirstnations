            <h2>Who Are the Druze?</h2>
            <p>The Druze are an Arabic-speaking ethnoreligious group concentrated in the mountainous regions of Lebanon, Syria, Israel, and Jordan. Numbering approximately 1-2 million worldwide, they practice a secretive monotheistic religion that emerged from Ismaili Islam in the 11th century but has developed into something entirely distinct. Closed to conversion since 1043 CE and guarding their scriptures from outsiders, the Druze have maintained their identity through centuries of persecution by cultivating warrior traditions, mountain refuge, and fierce communal solidarity.</p>

            <h2>Origins of the Faith</h2>
            <p>The Druze religion emerged in 1017 CE in Cairo when Fatimid Caliph al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah was proclaimed to be a manifestation of God by missionaries including Hamza ibn Ali and Muhammad ad-Darazi (from whose name "Druze" derives). After al-Hakim's mysterious disappearance in 1021, the movement faced persecution. In 1043, the faith was officially "closed"—no new converts would be accepted, and the Druze became a hereditary community defined by birth rather than belief.</p>
            <p>The Druze settled in mountainous areas of the Levant—Lebanon's Chouf Mountains, Syria's Jabal al-Druze, and later the Galilee and Golan Heights. These fortress-like landscapes provided protection from hostile powers and allowed the Druze to develop distinct communities. Their strategic locations made them important players in regional politics, with Druze leaders becoming prominent in Lebanese and Syrian history.</p>

            <h2>The Secret Religion</h2>
            <p>Druze theology remains largely secret, with religious knowledge restricted to the 'uqqal (initiated "sages") who have chosen a religious life and undergone spiritual training. The majority, called juhhal (the "unknowing"), are not taught religious doctrine but are expected to follow ethical principles and communal obligations. This division protects sacred knowledge while including all Druze in the community.</p>
            <p>What is known includes: belief in one God; belief in reincarnation (tanasukh) whereby Druze souls are immediately reborn into other Druze bodies; reverence for seven prophets including Adam, Abraham, and Jesus; belief that al-Hakim will return at the end of time; and rejection of traditional Islamic practices like fasting and pilgrimage. The sacred texts, the Epistles of Wisdom (Rasa'il al-Hikma), are studied only by the uqqal.</p>

            <h2>Social Structure and Identity</h2>
            <p>Druze identity is defined by birth—one must be born to two Druze parents to be Druze. There is no conversion in or out; a Druze who abandons the community cannot return, and a non-Druze cannot become Druze. This closure creates a tight-knit community where everyone is related through extended kin networks. Marriage outside the community is strongly discouraged, preserving genetic and cultural continuity.</p>
            <p>The uqqal are distinguished by dress—men wear white turbans and grow distinctive mustaches; women wear white head coverings. They abstain from alcohol and tobacco, attend weekly prayer meetings, and study religious texts. The juhhal live normal secular lives but maintain Druze identity through community participation, observance of ethical principles, and readiness to defend the community when threatened.</p>

            <h2>Warriors and Loyalty</h2>
            <p>The Druze have earned a reputation as formidable warriors, defending their mountain communities against larger forces throughout history. In the 17th century, Druze leader Fakhr al-Din II created an autonomous Lebanese emirate that challenged Ottoman authority. During the Syrian Civil War, Druze militias defended their communities against multiple threats. This martial tradition combined with tight communal bonds makes the Druze significant political actors despite small numbers.</p>
            <p>A distinctive Druze principle is taqiyya (dissimulation)—the permissibility of concealing one's faith under persecution. This allowed Druze to survive by outwardly conforming to dominant religions while maintaining belief privately. Related is the principle of loyalty to one's country of residence; Israeli Druze serve in the military and hold public positions, while Syrian Druze largely supported the Assad government. This situational loyalty has been criticized but reflects survival strategy developed over centuries of minority existence.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Challenges</h2>
            <p>Modern Druze face challenges to traditional community structure. In Israel, they are recognized as a distinct nationality and serve in the military, but struggle with land confiscation and second-class citizenship relative to Jews. In Syria, the civil war brought existential threats, with communities caught between regime, rebels, and ISIS. In Lebanon, political changes challenge Druze influence historically exercised through leadership of the Progressive Socialist Party.</p>
            <p>Diaspora communities in the Americas, Australia, and West Africa maintain identity but face assimilation pressures. Young Druze navigate between tradition and modernity, with some embracing secular lifestyles while maintaining ethnic identity, others seeking deeper religious knowledge, and some questioning the rigid boundaries that define Druze existence. The community's future depends on balancing these tensions while preserving the solidarity that has ensured survival for a millennium.</p>
