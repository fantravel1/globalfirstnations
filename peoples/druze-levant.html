            <h2>Who Are the Druze?</h2>
            <p>The Druze (Durūz or Muwahhidūn) are an ethno-religious community of approximately 1-2 million people inhabiting Lebanon, Syria, Israel, and Jordan, with diaspora communities worldwide. Emerging in 11th-century Egypt from Ismaili Islam, Druze belief incorporates elements of Islam, Neoplatonism, and Gnosticism into a distinct esoteric religion. The Druze faith is closed—one must be born Druze, and religious teachings are revealed only to initiated members (uqqāl). Known for fierce loyalty to their communities and the countries they inhabit, the Druze have survived as a minority through strategic adaptation across centuries of regional conflict.</p>

            <h2>The Esoteric Faith</h2>
            <p>Druze religious doctrine remains largely secret, revealed only to initiated religious men and women (uqqāl) who have demonstrated commitment through lifestyle restrictions. Core beliefs include the oneness of God (tawhid), reincarnation of souls among Druze only, and recognition of wisdom figures from multiple traditions including Jethro (Nabi Shu'ayb), Jesus, and Plato. The Druze do not proselytize, pray in conventional mosques, observe Ramadan, or make pilgrimage to Mecca. Their sacred texts, including the Epistles of Wisdom, are not shared with outsiders.</p>

            <h2>Mountain Fortresses</h2>
            <p>The Druze historically concentrated in mountain regions—the Chouf and Mount Lebanon in Lebanon, Jabal al-Druze in Syria, and Mount Carmel and the Golan Heights in Israel. Mountains provided defense against persecution and enabled community cohesion. The Druze became renowned as fierce warriors, defending their communities and serving as soldiers in various armies. Druze architecture features distinctive stone construction suited to mountain terrain. Even as urbanization draws Druze to cities, mountain villages remain cultural and religious centers.</p>

            <h2>Loyalty and Adaptation</h2>
            <p>The Druze developed a principle of taqiyya—outward conformity to dominant religions while maintaining inner faith—that enabled survival as a minority. More distinctively, Druze doctrine requires loyalty to the country of residence. Israeli Druze serve in the IDF; Syrian Druze have served the Assad regime; Lebanese Druze participate in that country's sectarian politics. This adaptability has ensured Druze survival but creates tensions when countries conflict. Druze have fought on opposing sides of regional wars, even against each other.</p>

            <h2>Gender and Religious Authority</h2>
            <p>Druze society exhibits complex gender dynamics. Religiously, women can achieve the highest spiritual status as initiated uqqāl, and female religious leaders command respect. The saint Sitt Sarah is revered. However, traditional Druze society also maintains honor cultures and patriarchal family structures. Druze personal status law, governing marriage and inheritance, varies by country. Younger Druze women increasingly access education and professional life while debates continue over balancing tradition and modernity. Female Druze scholars are challenging historical gender restrictions.</p>
