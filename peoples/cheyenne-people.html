            <h2>Who Are the Cheyenne?</h2>
            <p>The Cheyenne (Tsêhéstáno, "Beautiful People") are a Plains Indian nation numbering approximately 22,000—divided between the Northern Cheyenne Tribe in Montana (12,000) and the Southern Cheyenne in Oklahoma (12,000, enrolled with Arapaho). They speak Cheyenne, an Algonquian language. The Cheyenne migrated from the Great Lakes region to the Great Plains, transforming from agricultural village dwellers to quintessential horse-mounted buffalo hunters. Allied with the Arapaho and Lakota, the Cheyenne fiercely resisted American expansion, suffering devastating massacres at Sand Creek (1864) and Washita (1868) before military defeat.</p>

            <h2>Transformation to Plains Culture</h2>
            <p>Cheyenne ancestors lived in permanent villages in Minnesota, practicing agriculture. Pressure from other tribes pushed them westward (1700s); they adopted horse culture and became nomadic buffalo hunters. This transformation was remarkably complete—the Cheyenne became exemplary Plains Indians. The Council of Forty-Four (peace chiefs) governed; warrior societies (including the famous Dog Soldiers) provided military structure. The Sacred Arrow and Sacred Buffalo Hat ceremonies maintained spiritual power. The Sun Dance was central religious expression. Cheyenne warriors earned reputation for bravery; their society emphasized courage, generosity, and spiritual devotion.</p>

            <h2>Resistance and Massacres</h2>
            <p>The Cheyenne resisted American expansion with determination. The 1851 Fort Laramie Treaty guaranteed territory; miners and settlers violated it immediately. The Sand Creek Massacre (1864) saw Colorado militia attack a peaceful Cheyenne camp, killing 150-200, mostly women and children, despite their flying American flag and white surrender flag. The Washita Massacre (1868) by Custer's 7th Cavalry killed Chief Black Kettle and over 100 others. These atrocities hardened Cheyenne resistance; they joined Lakota at Little Bighorn (1876), where Custer was destroyed. But military defeat came; the Cheyenne were confined to reservations.</p>

            <h2>Northern Cheyenne Exodus</h2>
            <p>In 1878-79, Northern Cheyenne under Chiefs Dull Knife and Little Wolf fled their Oklahoma reservation—a 1,500-mile journey toward their Montana homeland through Army pursuit, starvation, and freezing weather. Captured and held at Fort Robinson, they broke out in January 1879 rather than return south; many were killed. Their determination eventually won: the Northern Cheyenne Reservation was established in Montana (1884). This exodus—one of the great resistance stories—demonstrated Cheyenne attachment to their homeland and willingness to die rather than submit.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Cheyenne</h2>
            <p>Modern Cheyenne maintain distinct Northern and Southern nations. The Northern Cheyenne Reservation in Montana prioritizes cultural preservation; the tribe has rejected coal mining despite economic pressure. The Southern Cheyenne share governance with Arapaho in Oklahoma. Language revitalization programs combat severe decline (fewer than 100 fluent speakers). Ceremonies—Sun Dance, Arrow Renewal—continue. Both nations face poverty and limited economic opportunities but maintain strong cultural identity. Sand Creek Massacre National Historic Site (2007) acknowledges the atrocity. How Cheyenne preserve language, protect land from extraction, and maintain culture shapes these Beautiful People's future.</p>
