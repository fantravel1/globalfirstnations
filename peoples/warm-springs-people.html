            <h2>Who Are the Confederated Tribes?</h2>
            <p>The Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs (CTWS) includes three distinct peoples: the Warm Springs (Wasco), Wasco proper, and Paiute, with approximately 5,200 enrolled members in north-central Oregon. The Warm Springs and Wasco signed the 1855 Treaty; Paiute peoples were later added after the Bannock War (1878). Warm Springs speak Sahaptin; Wasco speak Kiksht (Upper Chinook); and Paiute speak Northern Paiute—three completely different language families. This linguistic diversity within one reservation creates unique preservation challenges. The 644,000-acre reservation centers on the Deschutes River region.</p>

            <h2>Economic Innovation</h2>
            <p>The Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs pioneered tribal economic development. In 1967, they opened Kah-Nee-Ta Resort, one of the first tribally owned resorts in the country. Warm Springs Forest Products operates a major timber mill. The tribe holds significant water rights to the Deschutes River, licensing them to Portland General Electric for hydropower—generating substantial revenue. These diversified enterprises made CTWS one of the most economically successful tribes in the Pacific Northwest. This success demonstrates what tribes can achieve with adequate land bases and natural resources.</p>

            <h2>Three Languages, One Nation</h2>
            <p>CTWS faces the unusual challenge of preserving three completely unrelated languages within one tribal government. Ichishkíin (Sahaptin), spoken by the Warm Springs band, is related to Yakama and other Plateau languages. Kiksht (Wasco-Wishram), an Upper Chinookan language, was the basis of Chinook Jargon, the Pacific Northwest trade language. Northern Paiute belongs to the Numic family. All three are endangered, with the oldest fluent speakers dying. Language programs work to document and teach all three, but resources must be divided among multiple revitalization efforts.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary CTWS</h2>
            <p>Modern CTWS balances tradition and development. The Museum at Warm Springs preserves the heritage of all three peoples. Treaty fishing rights at Celilo Falls (now flooded by The Dalles Dam) were commuted to monetary settlements and continued fishing rights at other locations. The tribe manages extensive forest and rangeland. Kah-Nee-Ta Resort closed in 2018 due to facility issues, but economic diversification continues with other enterprises. How CTWS maintains three distinct cultural identities while operating as one nation shapes this unique confederation's ongoing development.</p>
