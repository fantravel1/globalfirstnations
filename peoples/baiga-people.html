            <h2>Who Are the Baiga?</h2>
            <p>The Baiga are a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) of central India, inhabiting the sal forests of Madhya Pradesh (particularly Baiga Chak, Dindori, Mandla, and Shahdol districts) and adjacent parts of Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand. Numbering approximately 400,000-500,000, they speak Baigani, a dialect of Chhattisgarhi (an Indo-Aryan language). The Baiga are distinguished by their traditional practice of bewar (shifting cultivation) and their deep spiritual connection to the forest. Colonial and post-colonial forest policies have severely impacted their way of life, as restrictions on bewar and forest access have undermined their traditional economy.</p>

            <h2>Bewar and Forest Life</h2>
            <p>Traditional Baiga identity centers on bewar—shifting cultivation involving clearing forest patches, burning vegetation, cultivating for 2-3 years, then moving on to let forest regenerate. The Baiga believed the earth was their mother and using a plow would wound her; hence they practiced dibbling (planting seeds in holes) rather than plowing. This spiritual prohibition made them distinct from neighboring agricultural communities. Forest products—tendu leaves, mahua flowers, honey, roots—supplemented cultivation. However, British colonial forest policy, continued after independence, banned bewar as destructive, forcing Baiga into settled agriculture or wage labor. This prohibition, while supposedly protecting forests, devastated Baiga economy and identity while failing to address actual deforestation drivers.</p>

            <h2>Tattoo Culture</h2>
            <p>Baiga women traditionally bore elaborate tattoos (godna) covering their bodies—one of India's most extensive tattooing traditions. Tattoos marked life stages, served as permanent ornaments that could not be taken away (unlike jewelry), and were believed to be carried into the afterlife. Designs included geometric patterns, plants, animals, and deity representations, applied by specialized women tattooists using thorns and lamp soot. The painful process spread over years. Tattooing has declined as younger generations adopt mainstream dress and values, though cultural revival efforts have renewed interest. Baiga tattoos represented a distinctive aesthetic tradition that literally inscribed identity onto women's bodies.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Baiga</h2>
            <p>Modern Baiga communities struggle with poverty, displacement, and cultural disruption. Tiger reserves and protected areas have displaced Baiga villages despite the Forest Rights Act (2006) theoretically protecting indigenous forest rights. Health indicators are among India's worst; malnutrition, infant mortality, and lack of healthcare access persist. Education has expanded but often disrupts cultural transmission. Some initiatives support Baiga livelihoods through non-timber forest product marketing. Cultural tourism provides limited opportunities. Activists advocate for proper implementation of forest rights, recognition of bewar as sustainable, and development that respects Baiga preferences. The Baiga case illustrates how conservation policies can harm indigenous peoples while failing to achieve environmental goals when they exclude forest-dwelling communities from their own lands.</p>
