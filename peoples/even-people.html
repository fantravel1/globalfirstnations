            <h2>Who Are the Even?</h2>
            <p>The Even (also called Evens, Lamuts, or Orochen) are a Tungusic people of northeastern Siberia, inhabiting territories from the Sea of Okhotsk to the Arctic Ocean across Yakutia, Magadan, Chukotka, and Kamchatka. Numbering approximately 22,000, they are closely related to the more numerous Evenki but developed distinct cultural adaptations to their mountainous and coastal environments. The Even speak the Even language, a Tungusic language with several dialects, spoken by approximately 5,500 people. Historically known as skilled reindeer herders and hunters, the Even developed unique riding-reindeer traditions that allowed them to traverse the rugged terrain of northeastern Siberia.</p>

            <h2>Reindeer Riding Culture</h2>
            <p>While many Siberian peoples herd reindeer for meat, milk, and transport, the Even developed a distinctive riding tradition using specially bred larger reindeer capable of carrying adult riders. This adaptation allowed travel through mountainous terrain where sledge travel was impractical. Even saddles and riding techniques influenced neighboring peoples. Traditional Even reindeer herding was semi-nomadic, following seasonal pastures across vast distances. The relationship between herder and reindeer was intimate; reindeer were individually named and their personalities known. Soviet collectivization disrupted traditional herding patterns; state farms replaced family-based herding. Post-Soviet collapse devastated the reindeer economy, though some communities have revived traditional practices.</p>

            <h2>Coastal and Mountain Life</h2>
            <p>Even territory spans diverse environments from the Sea of Okhotsk coast to interior mountains and Arctic tundra. Coastal Even groups incorporated marine hunting (seals, sea lions) into their economy alongside reindeer herding. Mountain Even specialized in hunting wild reindeer, mountain sheep, and bear. Freshwater fish supplemented the diet everywhere. This environmental diversity created regional cultural variations within Even society. The extreme climate demanded sophisticated material culture: warm clothing from reindeer hides, portable dwellings (similar to Evenki chum tents), and travel equipment for different seasons. Shamanism connected humans with animal spirits and nature beings; rituals maintained harmony with the environment that sustained Even life.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Even</h2>
            <p>Modern Even live across the Sakha Republic, Magadan Oblast, Chukotka, and Kamchatka. The Soviet period brought sedentarization, collectivization, and Russification; many Even lost their language and traditional skills. Post-Soviet economic collapse particularly affected reindeer herding communities dependent on state support. Today, some communities have revived small-scale herding; others work in mining, fishing, or government employment. The Even language is endangered; transmission to children has declined. Cultural revival efforts include language programs in some regions, cultural festivals, and documentation of traditional knowledge. Climate change poses new challenges: shifting vegetation affects reindeer pastures; permafrost thaw damages infrastructure. The Even face the challenge of maintaining cultural identity while adapting to rapid environmental and economic change.</p>
