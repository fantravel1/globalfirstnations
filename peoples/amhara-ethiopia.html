            <h2>Who Are the Amhara?</h2>
            <p>The Amhara are the second-largest ethnic group in Ethiopia, numbering approximately 32 million (about 27% of the population), primarily in the Amhara Region of the central highlands. They speak Amharic, a Semitic language that serves as Ethiopia's federal working language and is written in the distinctive Ge'ez script. The Amhara dominated Ethiopian imperial history—producing most emperors, including Haile Selassie—and spread Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity. Their language and culture shaped Ethiopian national identity, sometimes at the expense of other ethnic groups. Contemporary Amhara navigate complex ethnic federalism and conflict in a changing Ethiopia.</p>

            <h2>Imperial History</h2>
            <p>Ethiopian imperial history is largely Amhara history. The Solomonic dynasty (claiming descent from King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba) ruled from 1270 until 1974's Marxist revolution. Emperors like Tewodros II, Menelik II (who defeated Italy at Adwa, 1896), and Haile Selassie shaped modern Ethiopia. Amharic became the language of administration, law, and education; Amhara culture was treated as Ethiopian culture. This centralization spread Orthodox Christianity and Amharic while marginalizing other ethnic groups—creating grievances that fueled ethnic federalism's 1991 adoption. Understanding Ethiopia requires understanding Amhara imperial heritage and its contested legacy.</p>

            <h2>Ethiopian Orthodoxy</h2>
            <p>Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity, dating to the 4th century, is central to Amhara identity. Rock-hewn churches at Lalibela (carved by King Lalibela, c. 1200) are UNESCO World Heritage sites. The church claimed to hold the Ark of the Covenant at Axum. Distinctive practices—fasting regimens stricter than other Orthodox churches, the Tabot (ark replica) in each church, festival celebrations like Timkat (Epiphany)—shape Amhara life. Approximately 80% of Amhara are Orthodox. The church was linked to imperial power; its relationship with the modern secular state is complex. Religious identity distinguishes Amhara from Muslim Oromo neighbors, creating overlapping ethnic-religious fault lines.</p>

            <h2>Ethnic Federalism</h2>
            <p>Ethiopia's 1995 constitution established ethnic federalism—reorganizing the state along ethnic lines after the Derg regime fell. For Amhara, this was controversial: some saw their historical dominance replaced by other groups' power (especially Tigray, which led the EPRDF coalition until 2018). Amhara nationalists argue Amhara face territorial losses (in disputed regions) and political marginalization. The 2020-2022 Tigray War saw Amhara forces fighting alongside federal troops; subsequent violence has targeted Amhara civilians. These conflicts reflect ethnic federalism's tensions—how to balance ethnic self-determination with national unity in Ethiopia's diverse society.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Amhara</h2>
            <p>Modern Amhara face a changing Ethiopia. Their historic dominance ended; ethnic federalism creates new political dynamics. Agricultural challenges (land degradation, drought, population pressure) affect the highlands. Violence in contested regions—Tigray border areas, Oromia conflicts—creates displacement and insecurity. Yet Amhara cultural production continues: literature, music, and art thrive. Addis Ababa, though federal territory, remains culturally Amhara-influenced. How Amhara adapt from former imperial dominance to being one ethnic group among equals—while addressing grievances about marginalization and territory—shapes Ethiopia's precarious future.</p>
