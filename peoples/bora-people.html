            <h2>Who Are the Bora?</h2>
            <p>The Bora are an indigenous people of the Peru-Colombia border region, traditionally inhabiting the interfluvial forests between the Putumayo and Caquetá rivers. Today numbering approximately 3,000-4,000, they are closely related culturally and linguistically to the Miraña people. They speak Bora, a Boran language. Like their Huitoto neighbors, the Bora suffered catastrophic population loss during the rubber boom—from perhaps 15,000-20,000 to a few hundred survivors. They are known for their manguaré (slit drums) used for communication across forest distances, elaborate ceremonial dances, and the coca-tobacco ritual complex shared with neighboring peoples. Contemporary Bora have rebuilt their culture while adapting to new economic realities including tourism.</p>

            <h2>The Manguaré Drums</h2>
            <p>The manguaré are large slit drums carved from single tree trunks, traditionally played in pairs—a male (lower tone) and female (higher tone). Skilled drummers could communicate complex messages across kilometers of forest, announcing ceremonies, deaths, arrivals, and emergencies. Different rhythmic patterns conveyed specific messages understood across communities. The drums were housed in the maloca and played during ceremonies, accompanying dances and marking ritual stages. Making a manguaré was a major undertaking, requiring proper trees, skilled carving, and ceremonial treatment. The drums were considered to have spirits and were treated respectfully. While radio and telephones have replaced communication functions, manguaré remain central to ceremonies. The Bora drum tradition represents sophisticated acoustic technology adapted to the dense Amazonian forest environment.</p>

            <h2>Ceremonial Life</h2>
            <p>Bora ceremonial life centers on the maloca, the large communal longhouse where extended families live under a headman (dueño de maloca). Major ceremonies bring together multiple malocas for days of dancing, feasting, and ritual. Dancers wear elaborate costumes including bark cloth garments, feathered headdresses, and palm fiber skirts, representing ancestral beings and mythological figures. Men consume mambe (coca powder) and ambil (tobacco paste) throughout, enabling the proper state for ceremony. Dances follow specific patterns, with songs recounting origin myths and proper conduct. The ceremonial calendar follows ecological cycles—fruiting seasons, river levels—with different ceremonies appropriate to different times. Ceremonies reinforce social bonds, transmit cultural knowledge, and maintain relationships with the spirit world. The rubber era disrupted but did not destroy this ceremonial complex.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Bora</h2>
            <p>Modern Bora have engaged with tourism, particularly near Iquitos, Peru, where some communities welcome visitors for cultural demonstrations. This engagement provides income but raises questions about authenticity and cultural commodification—some performances are staged for tourists rather than genuine ceremonies. Traditional territories in the Colombia-Peru border region remain more isolated. The Bora language is endangered, with most speakers middle-aged or older, though revitalization efforts exist. Traditional knowledge of forest plants and animals remains extensive. Armed conflict and drug trafficking affect some Bora territories. The Ampiyacu-Apayacu Regional Conservation Area in Peru protects some traditional lands while allowing sustainable resource use. The Bora, like other Huitoto-area peoples, represent remarkable resilience—rebuilding culture from the rubber-era genocide while navigating contemporary challenges of market integration, language loss, and territorial pressure.</p>
