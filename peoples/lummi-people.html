            <h2>Who Are the Lummi?</h2>
            <p>The Lummi (Lhaq'temish) are an indigenous people of the Salish Sea, with approximately 5,300 enrolled members in the Lummi Nation (federally recognized). Their name Lhaq'temish means "People of the Sea." They speak Xwlemi Chosen (Lummi), a Central Salish language with very few first-language speakers remaining. Traditional Lummi territory included the San Juan Islands, Bellingham Bay, and the waters of the northern Salish Sea in Washington State. The Lummi are known as salmon people and reef net fishers; their unique reef net technology represents one of North America's most sophisticated fishing innovations.</p>

            <h2>Reef Net Fishing</h2>
            <p>The Lummi developed reef net fishing—a unique technology found nowhere else in North America. Reef nets, suspended between canoes at traditional locations, intercepted migrating salmon. Skilled fishers watched for schools approaching; when fish swam over the net, it was raised to trap them. This technology required precise knowledge of salmon behavior, water conditions, and tidal patterns. Reef net sites were hereditary property—valuable family assets passed through generations. The technique declined with colonization but has been revived; reef nets symbolize Lummi maritime expertise and connection to salmon. This fishing innovation demonstrates indigenous technological sophistication.</p>

            <h2>Treaty Rights and Activism</h2>
            <p>The Point Elliott Treaty (1855) reserved Lummi fishing rights "at usual and accustomed grounds." When Washington State attempted to restrict Indian fishing in the 20th century, the Lummi and other tribes fought back. The Boldt Decision (1974) affirmed treaty rights to half of harvestable fish—transforming Northwest fisheries. More recently, the Lummi have led opposition to the Gateway Pacific Terminal coal export proposal, defeating the project on environmental and treaty rights grounds. The tribe's successful campaign against the terminal demonstrated how treaty rights can protect not just tribal interests but broader environmental values.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Lummi</h2>
            <p>Modern Lummi balance traditional fishing with aquaculture innovation. The tribe operates extensive shellfish aquaculture operations—geoduck, oyster, and clam farming in Bellingham Bay. Gaming (Silver Reef Casino) provides revenue. The Lummi were pioneers in tribal healthcare, establishing one of the first tribally-operated health programs. The "House of Tears Carvers" continue canoe carving traditions; ocean-going canoes participate in the annual Tribal Canoe Journey. Orca (sk'aliCh'elh-tenaut) protection is a tribal priority—Lummi hold ceremonies for and release salmon to the endangered Southern Resident killer whales. How Lummi sustain marine-based culture while protecting Salish Sea ecosystems shapes this sea people's future.</p>
