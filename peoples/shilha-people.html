            <h2>Who Are the Shilha?</h2>
            <p>The Shilha (Ishelhin, also called Chleuh or Souss Berbers) are an Amazigh people of southern Morocco, inhabiting the High Atlas Mountains, Anti-Atlas, and Souss Valley. Numbering approximately 8-10 million, they are Morocco's largest Berber group. They speak Tashelhit (Shilha), the most widely spoken Berber language, with an ancient literary tradition using the Tifinagh script. The Shilha homeland spans Morocco's most dramatic landscapes—from North Africa's highest peaks (Toubkal, 4,167m) to Atlantic coastal plains. Their region includes Marrakech's hinterland and the historic city of Taroudant, centers of Berber culture that have both integrated with and resisted Arab-Islamic dynasties for centuries.</p>

            <h2>Mountain and Valley Life</h2>
            <p>Traditional Shilha economy combined mountain pastoralism with irrigated agriculture in valleys. The High Atlas villages cultivated terraced fields using sophisticated irrigation systems (targa), growing grains, fruits, and vegetables. Transhumance moved flocks between valley and mountain pastures. The Souss Valley became known for argan trees (whose nuts produce argan oil) and saffron cultivation. Architecture featured distinctive kasbahs (fortified residences) and ksour (fortified villages), adobe structures adapted to the arid climate. Village governance through collective assemblies (jmaa) managed resources and resolved disputes. This mountain-valley adaptation sustained dense populations in challenging environments while maintaining distinctive cultural practices.</p>

            <h2>Tashelhit Literature</h2>
            <p>Tashelhit possesses the richest literary tradition among Berber languages. Poetry has been composed and transmitted for centuries; genres include praise poetry, love poetry, satirical verse, and religious compositions. The tradition of amarg (poetry) and aḥwash (collective song and dance) remains vibrant. Religious scholars wrote Berber-language Islamic texts, creating a unique literary heritage. The Tifinagh alphabet—used by Berbers since antiquity—has been revived for modern Tashelhit writing. Publication in Tashelhit has grown since Morocco's recognition of Amazigh as an official language (2011). This literary tradition has provided resources for contemporary cultural revival and education, distinguishing Tashelhit among Berber languages often characterized as primarily oral.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Shilha</h2>
            <p>Modern Shilha communities navigate tradition and change. Tourism has transformed some areas—trekking in the High Atlas, visiting kasbahs, experiencing "Berber hospitality"—providing income while raising questions about cultural commodification. Migration to Moroccan cities (Casablanca, Marrakech) and Europe has created diaspora communities while depopulating some villages. The argan oil industry, traditionally women's work, has become internationally commercialized, with cooperatives providing income. Education has expanded, though rural areas still lag. Amazigh cultural activism has achieved constitutional recognition, but implementation—particularly Tashelhit-language education—remains incomplete. The Shilha represent the largest Berber population navigating Morocco's complex identity politics, where Arabization coexists with growing Amazigh consciousness.</p>
