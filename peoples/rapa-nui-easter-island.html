            <h2>Who Are the Rapa Nui?</h2>
            <p>The Rapa Nui are the indigenous Polynesian people of Easter Island (Rapa Nui), one of the world's most isolated inhabited places, located 3,700 kilometers west of Chile. Arriving around 1200 CE, they developed a remarkable civilization that created the iconic moai—massive stone statues weighing up to 82 tons. The island's history, including environmental transformation and population collapse, has become a parable for ecological sustainability, though modern scholarship challenges earlier "ecocide" narratives.</p>

            <h2>The Moai: Stone Giants</h2>
            <p>The moai are monolithic human figures carved from volcanic rock at the Rano Raraku quarry and transported across the island to ceremonial platforms (ahu). Averaging 4 meters tall and 12 tons, the largest completed moai reaches 10 meters. The statues represent deified ancestors, their eyes (once inlaid with coral and obsidian) gazing inland to watch over villages. How the Rapa Nui moved these massive statues without wheels or draft animals remains debated—recent experiments suggest "walking" them upright using ropes, matching oral traditions.</p>

            <h2>Rongorongo: Undeciphered Script</h2>
            <p>Rongorongo is a system of glyphs carved onto wooden tablets, one of very few independent inventions of writing in human history. Only about two dozen tablets survive, most having been destroyed by missionaries or lost. Despite over a century of attempts, rongorongo remains undeciphered—scholars debate whether it represents true writing, proto-writing, or mnemonic devices. The loss of literate elders during 19th-century slave raids took the knowledge to the grave. Decipherment would revolutionize understanding of Rapa Nui history and Polynesian civilization.</p>

            <h2>Collapse and Survival</h2>
            <p>The traditional "ecocide" narrative blamed Rapa Nui for destroying their forests to move moai, causing population collapse. Modern research reveals a more complex story: deforestation occurred partly due to introduced rats eating palm seeds; population decline was gradual until European contact brought devastating slave raids (1862) and diseases that reduced the population to just 111 people by 1877. The survivors maintained cultural knowledge against tremendous odds. Chilean annexation in 1888 brought further hardships including forced labor and land dispossession.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Rapa Nui</h2>
            <p>Today's Rapa Nui community has grown to approximately 7,700, most living in the single town of Hanga Roa. Tourism dominates the economy, bringing income but raising concerns about overdevelopment and cultural commodification. Rapa Nui activists campaign for greater autonomy from Chile, return of artifacts held in foreign museums, and control over their cultural heritage. The Rapa Nui language has co-official status but faces pressure from Spanish. Cultural revival efforts include traditional navigation, tattooing, and the annual Tapati Rapa Nui festival.</p>
