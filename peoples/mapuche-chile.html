            <h2>Who Are the Mapuche?</h2>
            <p>The Mapuche ("people of the land") are the largest indigenous group in the Southern Cone of South America, inhabiting south-central Chile and southwestern Argentina. Famous for being the only indigenous American people never fully conquered by European colonizers, they resisted Spanish invasion for over 300 years before Chilean and Argentine military campaigns finally subdued them in the 1880s. Today, approximately 1.7 million Mapuche maintain their identity while fighting for land rights and cultural recognition.</p>

            </div>

            <h2>The Arauco War</h2>
            <p>When Spanish conquistadors arrived in the 1540s, they expected easy conquest as in Peru and Mexico. Instead, the Mapuche mounted fierce resistance that continued for over three centuries—the longest indigenous resistance to European colonialism in the Americas. Mapuche warriors quickly adopted Spanish horses and weapons, becoming formidable cavalry. The Biobío River became a frontier boundary recognized by treaties. Only in the 1880s did Chilean and Argentine armies, using modern weapons and tactics, finally occupy Mapuche territory in campaigns called the "Pacification of Araucanía" (Chile) and "Conquest of the Desert" (Argentina).</p>

            <h2>Machi: Spiritual Leaders</h2>
            <p>The machi is the traditional Mapuche shaman and healer, usually a woman who enters trance states to communicate with spirits, diagnose illness, and perform healing ceremonies. Machi use the kultrun (sacred drum) decorated with cosmological symbols and the rewe (carved wooden altar). Their knowledge encompasses medicinal plants, spiritual healing, and maintaining balance between the human and spirit worlds. Machi have faced persecution but remain central to Mapuche spirituality, with ceremonies gaining renewed importance in cultural revival movements.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Land Struggles</h2>
            <p>The Mapuche lost over 90% of their ancestral territory during the late 19th-century military campaigns. Today, conflicts over land dominate Mapuche politics. Forestry companies, hydroelectric projects, and agricultural expansion continue displacing Mapuche communities. Some activists have occupied lands and sabotaged forestry equipment, leading to prosecutions under anti-terrorism laws inherited from the Pinochet dictatorship. The Chilean state has been condemned by international bodies for these prosecutions. Mapuche demands for territorial autonomy, return of ancestral lands, and constitutional recognition remain unresolved.</p>

            <h2>Cultural Renaissance</h2>
            <p>Mapudungun, the Mapuche language, is experiencing revival efforts after decades of decline. Bilingual education programs, radio stations broadcasting in Mapudungun, and urban Mapuche organizations work to maintain the language. Traditional weaving, silverwork, and music continue as living arts. The wetripantu (Mapuche New Year, at the June winter solstice) is increasingly celebrated publicly. Young Mapuche reclaim identity often obscured by generations of discrimination, asserting indigenous rights within Chilean society while challenging historical narratives of national identity.</p>
