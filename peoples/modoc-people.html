            <h2>Who Are the Modoc?</h2>
            <p>The Modoc are an indigenous people of the California-Oregon border region, now enrolled in the Klamath Tribes of Oregon (approximately 5,000 members total with Klamath and Yahooskin peoples) or the Modoc Nation of Oklahoma (descended from those exiled after the Modoc War). Their name derives from Móatokni, meaning "southerners" in Klamath. They speak Modoc, closely related to Klamath (Plateau Penutian family), now critically endangered. The Modoc are famous for their resistance in the Modoc War (1872-1873), when 53 warriors held off over 1,000 US troops for months in the volcanic Lava Beds of northern California—one of the most remarkable defensive stands in American history.</p>

            <h2>Tule Lake Homeland</h2>
            <p>Traditional Modoc territory centered on Tule Lake and Lower Klamath Lake—vast wetlands on the California-Oregon border teeming with waterfowl, fish, and tule reeds. Modocs built villages on lake shores, harvesting wokas (water lily seeds), fish, and birds. Tule (bulrush) provided material for boats, houses, and clothing. The surrounding uplands offered roots, seeds, and game. This rich environment supported perhaps 2,000 Modocs in villages loosely organized under headmen. Relations with Klamath neighbors to the north were generally peaceful; with Pit River peoples to the south, often hostile. The arrival of Euro-Americans transformed this world catastrophically.</p>

            <h2>The Modoc War</h2>
            <p>The Modoc War (1872-1873) remains one of the most famous Indian conflicts. After refusing to remain on the Klamath Reservation in Oregon, Captain Jack (Kintpuash) led approximately 160 Modocs—including only 53 warriors—into the Lava Beds near Tule Lake. From this volcanic fortress of caves, trenches, and lava flows, they repulsed repeated Army attacks. The conflict escalated when Captain Jack killed General Edward Canby during peace negotiations—the only general killed in an Indian war. Eventually betrayed by internal divisions, Captain Jack surrendered. He and three others were hanged; 153 Modocs were exiled to Indian Territory (Oklahoma). The Lava Beds became a National Monument.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Modoc</h2>
            <p>Modern Modocs are divided between Oregon and Oklahoma. The Modoc Nation in Oklahoma, descended from war exiles, returned to federal recognition in 1978 after 1950s termination. The Klamath Tribes (Oregon), including Modocs who didn't join Captain Jack, were terminated in 1954 and restored in 1986. Both groups work to preserve Modoc language and culture despite geographical separation. The Lava Beds National Monument interprets Modoc War history; the tribe seeks greater involvement in managing ancestral sites. Tule Lake, converted to farmland, holds different historical meaning—it was also a Japanese American internment camp during World War II. How Modocs reunite communities, revive language, and reclaim history shapes their future.</p>
