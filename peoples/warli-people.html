            <h2>Who Are the Warli?</h2>
            <p>The Warli are an Adivasi (indigenous) people of the Western Ghats region in Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Dadra and Nagar Haveli in western India. Numbering approximately 500,000-700,000, they inhabit the hilly, forested areas north of Mumbai. They speak Warli, an Indo-Aryan language (unlike most central Indian tribal languages which are Dravidian or Munda). The Warli are internationally famous for their distinctive painting tradition—ritualistic wall art featuring white geometric figures on red-ochre backgrounds that has achieved global recognition while remaining rooted in agricultural ceremonies and spirit veneration.</p>

            <h2>Warli Painting</h2>
            <p>Warli art is one of India's oldest and most distinctive folk painting traditions, possibly dating back 2,500-3,000 years based on similarities to prehistoric rock art. Traditionally, women paint on the mud walls of their homes during weddings and festivals. White pigment (rice paste mixed with water and gum) creates geometric figures—circles, triangles, and squares representing basic elements and human forms—against red-ochre backgrounds. The central motif is often Palghat (the mother goddess) or the tarpa dance, where figures spiral around a musician. Painting was sacred, not commercial; it invoked deities and ensured fertility. Since the 1970s, artists like Jivya Soma Mashe pioneered commercial Warli art on paper and canvas, bringing the tradition international recognition while sparking debates about authenticity and sacred versus commercial art.</p>

            <h2>Agricultural Spirituality</h2>
            <p>Warli religion centers on nature spirits and agricultural fertility rather than the Hindu pantheon (though syncretism has occurred). Waghdev (tiger god), Naran Dev (the supreme deity), and numerous village spirits receive veneration through sacrifices, rituals, and painted invocations. The annual tarpa festival following harvest features community dancing to the tarpa (a traditional wind instrument). Rice cultivation, supplemented by millet, vegetables, and forest gathering, structures the ceremonial calendar. Traditional practices including animal sacrifice have faced pressure from Hindu reformists and animal rights activists. The forest environment is integral to Warli spirituality; deforestation and development threaten not just livelihoods but the sacred landscape that grounds Warli identity.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Warli</h2>
            <p>Modern Warli communities face tensions between tradition and change. Proximity to Mumbai—India's commercial capital—brings both opportunities and disruptions. Many Warli work as laborers in construction and agriculture outside their territory. Warli art has become a substantial commercial success; paintings sell in galleries worldwide, and the style appears on textiles, home goods, and corporate designs. This success provides income but raises intellectual property concerns—much "Warli art" is produced by non-Warli copying the style. Government programs and NGOs support Warli artists while working on broader development. Education has expanded; young Warli increasingly pursue opportunities beyond traditional agriculture. The Warli navigate modernization while their ancient painting tradition, transformed from ritual to commodity, carries their culture to global audiences.</p>
