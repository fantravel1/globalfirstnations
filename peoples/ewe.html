            <h2>Who Are the Ewe?</h2>
            <p>The Ewe (pronounced EH-veh or EH-way) are a major ethnic group of approximately 7 million people living primarily in southeastern Ghana (Volta Region), southern Togo, and southwestern Benin. Speaking the Ewe language (a member of the Gbe language cluster), they share cultural ties with neighboring Fon, Aja, and Gen peoples. The Ewe are internationally renowned for their extraordinarily complex polyrhythmic drumming traditions, which have influenced global music from Afrobeat to jazz. Politically organized into numerous independent chiefdoms rather than a centralized kingdom, the Ewe traditionally valued personal achievement and maintained sophisticated systems of governance, religion, and artistic expression.</p>

            <h2>The World's Most Complex Drumming</h2>
            <p>Ewe drumming is considered by ethnomusicologists to be among the most sophisticated rhythmic traditions on Earth. Unlike Western music with a single dominant beat, Ewe music features **4 to 7 different rhythms played simultaneously**, each with its own timeline that interlocks with others in complex patterns. The **master drummer** (azaguno) coordinates the ensemble, signaling changes through specific patterns. Key drums include the **atsimevu** (master drum), **sogo** (response drum), **kidi** (talking drum), and **kagan** (high-pitched timekeeper). The bell pattern (played on the **gankogui**) provides the organizing principle—what Western musicians call the "clave" derives from this concept. The Ewe concept of music as collective conversation, where each part responds to others, has profoundly influenced jazz, Cuban music, and contemporary world music.</p>

            <h2>Vodun Religion and Spiritual Traditions</h2>
            <p>The Ewe are one of the source cultures of **Vodun** (Voodoo), which traveled to the Americas via the Atlantic slave trade, becoming Haitian Vodou, Louisiana Voodoo, and Brazilian Candomblé. Ewe Vodun centers on **Mawu-Lisa** (the supreme creator deity, encompassing both female and male aspects), lesser **trowo** (deities/spirits) associated with natural phenomena, and venerated ancestors. **Legba**, the divine messenger who opens doorways between worlds, features prominently in ceremonies. Priests and priestesses train for years to serve specific deities, entering possession-trance during rituals. The **Afa** divination system, similar to Yoruba Ifá, uses palm nuts or chains to communicate with the spiritual realm. While many Ewe today are Christian, traditional religion remains vital, with vodun shrines, festivals, and ceremonies continuing throughout Ewe territory.</p>

            <h2>Kente and Artistic Traditions</h2>
            <p>While Akan peoples developed kente in the Ashanti region, the Ewe developed their own distinct **kente** tradition, typically featuring more colors and different symbolic patterns. Ewe kente, woven on simpler horizontal looms (versus Ashanti vertical looms), features geometric designs with specific meanings: zigzag patterns representing life's difficulties, straight lines symbolizing order, and color combinations conveying messages about status and occasion. Beyond textiles, Ewe artistry encompasses carved **ancestral figures** (venovi) representing twins or deceased children, elaborate **funeral cloths** and ceremonies, and the famous **fantasy coffins** (abebuu adekai) pioneered by Ga and Ewe craftsmen, creating coffins shaped as cars, fish, airplanes, or other objects representing the deceased's life. Ewe blacksmiths traditionally held special spiritual status, with ironworking knowledge considered sacred.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Ewe Life</h2>
            <p>The Ewe live divided across Ghana, Togo, and Benin—a legacy of colonial borders that separated related communities. Pan-Ewe identity persists across these boundaries, with families maintaining cross-border connections and annual festivals drawing Ewe from all three countries. In Ghana, Ewe comprise about 13% of the population and have produced notable leaders, including the first president Kwame Nkrumah's close ally Komla Gbedemah. The Volta Region's economy centers on fishing, farming (cocoa, palm oil), and increasingly tourism attracted by festivals like **Hogbetsotso** (exodus festival) celebrating Ewe migration history. Ewe drumming has gained global recognition through master drummers teaching in universities worldwide and ensembles like Mustapha Tettey Addy's groups. Challenges include tensions between traditional chieftaincy and modern governance, youth migration to urban areas, and maintaining language vitality as English and French dominate education and commerce.</p>
