            <h2>Who Are the Oroch?</h2>
            <p>The Oroch (also Orochi) are an indigenous Tungusic people of the Russian Far East, numbering approximately 600-900 persons. They inhabit the coastal regions along the Tatar Strait in Khabarovsk Krai and parts of northern Primorsky Krai, living in river valleys draining to the Sea of Japan. They speak Oroch, a Southern Tungusic language closely related to Udege. The Oroch are primarily hunters and fishermen, combining maritime resources with taiga hunting. Their small population and assimilation pressures make them one of Russia's most endangered indigenous peoples.</p>

            <h2>Coastal and Taiga Economy</h2>
            <p>The Oroch developed a dual economy exploiting both maritime and taiga resources. Along the coast, they hunted sea mammals including seals and sea lions, and fished the rich waters of the Tatar Strait. Salmon runs up coastal rivers provided abundant seasonal catches. In the forested valleys, they hunted fur-bearing animals, elk, and other taiga game. Birch-bark canoes served for river travel; larger boats for coastal navigation. This combination of coastal and interior resources distinguished the Oroch from purely maritime peoples like the Nivkh or purely taiga peoples like the Udege, though they shared traits with both.</p>

            <h2>Material Culture</h2>
            <p>Oroch material culture reflected their environmental adaptations. Like other Amur peoples, they created fish-skin clothing, though this tradition has largely disappeared. Birch bark provided material for containers, dwellings, and canoes. Wood carving produced utilitarian and ritual objects. The Oroch built semi-subterranean winter houses and lighter summer dwellings suited to their seasonal movements. Traditional clothing featured intricate embroidery and appliqué. Soviet-era settlement policies concentrated the dispersed Oroch in villages, disrupting traditional settlement patterns and undermining the seasonal mobility their economy required.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Oroch</h2>
            <p>Modern Oroch face severe challenges of cultural survival. The Oroch language is critically endangered with perhaps only a few dozen elderly speakers remaining; most Oroch speak Russian. The community is scattered across several villages in Vanino Raion. Economic opportunities are limited; some engage in fishing or forest work. Intermarriage with Russians and other groups has been extensive. Cultural documentation efforts attempt to record what remains of traditional knowledge. The Oroch situation exemplifies the precarious position of Russia's smallest indigenous peoples—too few to maintain institutional support for language and culture, yet struggling to preserve distinct identity. Their survival as a separate people remains uncertain.</p>
