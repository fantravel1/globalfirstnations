            <h2>Who Are the Rapa Nui?</h2>
            <p>The Rapa Nui are the Polynesian people of Easter Island (Rapa Nui in their language), the world's most isolated inhabited island, located over 2,000 kilometers from the nearest population center in the southeastern Pacific Ocean. Currently numbering approximately **7,000 people** (including diaspora in mainland Chile), they are descendants of Polynesian voyagers who settled the island between 1200-1300 CE. The Rapa Nui are globally famous for creating the **moai**—nearly 900 monumental stone statues, some reaching 10 meters tall and weighing 80 tons, that once stood on ceremonial platforms (ahu) around the island. Their history encompasses remarkable cultural achievements, ecological crisis, and devastating depopulation from slavery and disease, followed by modern cultural revival.</p>

            <h2>The Mystery of the Moai</h2>
            <p>The **moai** represent ancestors and important chiefs, believed to embody their **mana** (spiritual power) which protected and blessed the community. Carved from volcanic tuff at the Rano Raraku quarry, they were transported—using methods still debated by archaeologists—to **ahu** (stone platforms) around the island's coastline, where they stood facing inland to watch over villages. Most moai were topped with red scoria "topknots" (pukao) and once had coral eyes that were inserted during ceremonies. The statue-building tradition flourished from approximately 1250-1500 CE, representing enormous investment of labor and resources. By the time Europeans arrived in 1722, the tradition had largely ceased, and by the 19th century, all moai had been toppled—whether by earthquakes, European interference, or internal conflict remains contested. Modern archaeological understanding rejects earlier "ecocide" narratives, showing a more complex history of adaptation and resilience.</p>

            <h2>Rongorongo and Cultural Achievements</h2>
            <p>Beyond the moai, Rapa Nui culture produced remarkable achievements. **Rongorongo** is a system of glyphs carved on wooden tablets, discovered in the 19th century. Whether it represents true writing, proto-writing, or mnemonic devices remains undeciphered—it would be the only indigenous writing system developed in Oceania and one of few invented independently anywhere. The **Birdman cult** (Tangata manu) replaced moai-building, centering on an annual competition where representatives of competing clans swam to offshore islets to retrieve the first sooty tern egg of the season—the winner's chief became the sacred Birdman for a year. Rapa Nui also developed sophisticated agriculture, including unique stone-mulch gardens (manavai) that protected crops from wind and conserved moisture, enabling survival on a resource-limited island.</p>

            <h2>Catastrophe and Survival</h2>
            <p>The Rapa Nui experienced near-extinction. Initial European contact (1722) was followed by sporadic visits until the catastrophic **Peruvian slave raids** of 1862-1863, when approximately 1,500 Rapa Nui—perhaps half the population, including most of the educated elite—were kidnapped to work in Peruvian guano mines. International pressure secured release for survivors, but smallpox killed most on the return voyage; only 15 returned to the island, bringing disease that further devastated the population. By 1877, only **111 Rapa Nui** remained. Chile annexed the island in 1888, subsequently confining residents to a single village while leasing most of the island to sheep ranchers. Full Chilean citizenship came only in 1966. From this nadir, the Rapa Nui people have rebuilt their population and culture.</p>

            <h2>Cultural Renaissance</h2>
            <p>The late 20th and early 21st centuries brought remarkable cultural revival. The **Rapa Nui language**, which had declined dramatically, is now taught in schools and spoken by thousands. Traditional arts—carving, tattooing, dance, and music—flourish, particularly around the annual **Tapati Rapa Nui** festival, a two-week celebration featuring competitions in traditional skills. Archaeological restoration has re-erected many moai, transforming the island into a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Yet challenges persist: Chilean governance remains contested, with many Rapa Nui advocating for greater autonomy or independence; tourism brings income but threatens fragile ecosystems and cultural authenticity; and land rights disputes continue. The Rapa Nui demonstrate how a people can recover from near-destruction to reassert cultural identity and seek self-determination.</p>
