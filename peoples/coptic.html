            <h2>Who Are the Coptic People?</h2>
            <p>The Copts (from Greek Aigyptos, "Egypt") are the indigenous Christian people of Egypt, direct descendants of ancient Egyptians predating the 7th-century Arab conquest. Numbering 10-20 million (estimates vary widely, constituting 10-20% of Egypt's population), Copts maintain distinct ethno-religious identity through the Coptic Orthodox Church, preservation of the Coptic language (descended from ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics), and continuous cultural heritage spanning over 4,000 years. While Egypt officially recognizes no indigenous peoples, Copts are widely considered indigenous by international scholarship and diaspora communities as the pre-Arab inhabitants of the Nile Valley. They face systemic discrimination, periodic sectarian violence, restrictions on church building, and underrepresentation in government while preserving one of Christianity's oldest continuous traditions.</p>

            <h2>Ancient Egyptian Continuity and Coptic Language</h2>
            <p>Copts represent unbroken biological and cultural continuity from pharaonic Egypt through Greco-Roman Egypt to the present. The **Coptic language** is the final stage of ancient Egyptian, evolved from hieroglyphic through demotic scripts, now written in Greek alphabet with seven additional letters from demotic. While Coptic ceased being a spoken vernacular language in the 17th century (replaced by Arabic), it survives as the liturgical language of the Coptic Orthodox Church and in a living revival movement teaching Coptic to youth. Genetic studies confirm Copts' direct descent from ancient Egyptians with minimal admixture. Traditional Coptic names (Boutros, Girgis, Mina) differ from Arabic Muslim names. Cultural practices preserve ancient Egyptian elements: agricultural festivals tied to Nile floods, dietary traditions, folk medicine, and architectural motifs in churches echoing pharaonic temples.</p>

            <h2>Coptic Orthodox Christianity</h2>
            <p>The **Coptic Orthodox Church**, founded by Saint Mark in Alexandria (1st century CE), represents one of Christianity's oldest institutions. Copts split from Byzantine Christianity at the Council of Chalcedon (451 CE) over Christological disputes, maintaining Miaphysite theology. The Church preserved Christianity through 1,400 years of Islamic rule, serving as repository of Coptic identity. Distinctive practices include: elaborate liturgies lasting 3-4 hours in Coptic and Arabic, strict fasting (over 200 days yearly), veneration of Egyptian martyrs, monasticism originating in Egyptian desert (St. Anthony, St. Pachomius), and unique ecclesiastical calendar. The **Pope of Alexandria** (currently Pope Tawadros II) leads the Church from Cairo. Ancient monasteries like St. Catherine's (Sinai) and St. Anthony's preserve manuscripts, icons, and continuous monastic tradition since the 4th century.</p>

            <h2>Persecution and Discrimination</h2>
            <p>Copts endured systematic oppression since the Arab conquest (641 CE): conversion pressure, jizya tax on non-Muslims, restrictions on church repair, forced Arabization, and periodic violence. While the 20th century brought formal equality, discrimination persists: **sectarian attacks** including church bombings (Alexandria 2011, killed 23; Tanta and Alexandria 2017, killed 45; Minya bus attack 2017, killed 29), kidnappings forcing conversion and marriage of Coptic girls, restricted church construction requiring presidential approval, underrepresentation in military and government (less than 1% of parliament despite 10%+ population), and economic marginalization. The 2011 **Maspero massacre** saw Egyptian military kill 27 Coptic protesters. Social discrimination includes employment barriers, housing discrimination, and social pressure. Hundreds of thousands emigrated creating diaspora communities in US, Canada, Australia preserving culture.</p>

            <h2>Cultural Preservation and Contemporary Challenges</h2>
            <p>Copts maintain distinct cultural identity through religious institutions, endogamous marriage preferences, traditional crafts (especially metalwork, woodworking, textiles), and festivals blending Christian and ancient Egyptian elements. The **Coptic cross** (ankh-derived), Coptic art and iconography, and religious music preserve unique aesthetics. However, challenges mount: **Arabization** eroding Coptic language knowledge, youth emigration to West seeking opportunities, Islamic conservatism limiting Christian expression, and internal church debates over modernization. Coptic revival movements teach language in schools, document oral traditions, advocate for minority rights, and strengthen diaspora connections. The fundamental question remains whether Copts can maintain distinct indigenous Egyptian Christian identity amid demographic pressure, emigration, and political marginalization in their ancestral Nile homeland.</p>
