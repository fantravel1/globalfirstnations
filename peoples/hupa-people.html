            <h2>Who Are the Hupa?</h2>
            <p>The Hupa (Hoopa) are an indigenous people of northwestern California, traditionally inhabiting the Hoopa Valley along the Trinity River in present-day Humboldt County. They speak Hupa, an Athabaskan language related to Navajo and Apache—evidence of an ancient migration from the subarctic. Before contact, the Hupa numbered approximately 1,000-2,000 people. Today, the Hoopa Valley Tribe is one of California's largest in terms of both population (approximately 3,000 enrolled members) and land base. The Hoopa Valley Reservation, established in 1864, encompasses 144 square miles of the ancestral homeland—an unusually large reservation by California standards—providing a foundation for cultural continuity and self-governance.</p>

            <h2>Salmon Culture</h2>
            <p>Traditional Hupa culture centered on salmon, which formed the dietary mainstay and cultural focus. The Trinity River provided abundant runs of king (Chinook) and silver (coho) salmon, supplemented by steelhead and other species. Fish were caught using weirs spanning the river, sophisticated engineering projects that required community coordination and specialized knowledge. Acorns from tan oaks provided the other dietary staple. Deer hunting, gathering, and trade with coastal peoples rounded out the economy. The Hupa are among California's few peoples speaking an Athabaskan language, likely reflecting migration from the north perhaps 1,000 years ago. Despite linguistic differences, they developed cultural connections with neighboring Yurok and Karuk peoples, sharing ceremonial complexes and participating in joint rituals.</p>

            <h2>World Renewal Ceremonies</h2>
            <p>The Hupa share the World Renewal ceremonial complex with neighboring Yurok and Karuk. These ceremonies—including the White Deerskin Dance and Jump Dance—are conducted to renew the world, ensure good salmon runs, and maintain cosmic balance. Participants display heirloom regalia: white deerskins, obsidian blades, and dentalia shells that constitute family treasures passed through generations. Ceremonies rotate among villages and occur at specific traditional sites. Unlike many California ceremonies suppressed during the colonial period, Hupa World Renewal dances continued with only brief interruption and remain central to community life today. These ceremonies attract participants and observers from throughout the region, reinforcing cultural identity and inter-tribal connections.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Hupa</h2>
            <p>Modern Hoopa Valley Tribe manages substantial forest resources—the reservation's timber has historically provided economic support, though sustainable management has become the focus. The tribe operates a fish hatchery, health services, schools, and various enterprises. Cultural continuity benefits from the intact homeland: many Hupa live on ancestral lands where families have resided for generations. Language preservation is a priority; Hupa is endangered but maintained through tribal language programs. World Renewal ceremonies continue annually. The tribe has been active in salmon restoration efforts, working to recover runs damaged by dams and water diversions. The Hupa represent one of California's most successful cases of indigenous cultural and territorial persistence.</p>
