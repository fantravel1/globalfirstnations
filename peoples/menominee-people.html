            <h2>Who Are the Menominee?</h2>
            <p>The Menominee are an Algonquian-speaking people of Wisconsin, with approximately 9,500 enrolled members in the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin (federally recognized). Their name derives from the Ojibwe word for wild rice—"manoomin"—referring to the grain central to their diet. They speak Menominee, an Algonquian language with fewer than 50 fluent speakers. The Menominee have occupied their Wisconsin homeland for at least 10,000 years—longer than any other tribe in the region. They are world-renowned for sustainable forestry practices that maintain productive forest while preserving ecological integrity.</p>

            <h2>Sustainable Forestry</h2>
            <p>The Menominee forest is a model of sustainable management recognized worldwide. The 235,000-acre forest has been logged continuously since 1854 yet contains more standing timber today than when logging began. This achievement reflects indigenous forest management philosophy: harvesting should never exceed growth; forest health takes precedence over short-term profit. Selective cutting, long rotations, and attention to forest structure maintain diverse, healthy ecosystems while producing high-quality timber. Forestry scientists study Menominee practices; the forest has received numerous environmental awards. This success demonstrates that indigenous land management can sustain both communities and ecosystems.</p>

            <h2>Termination and Restoration</h2>
            <p>The Menominee were among the first tribes targeted for termination (1954). Congress ended their federal recognition, dissolved their reservation, and converted it into a county. The results were devastating: the forest was mismanaged for short-term profit, services collapsed, poverty deepened. Menominee organized to reverse termination; Ada Deer led the restoration effort that succeeded in 1973—the first terminated tribe to regain recognition. This experience made the Menominee symbols of both termination's destructiveness and Native American self-determination. The restoration demonstrated that termination policy was a failure.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Menominee</h2>
            <p>Modern Menominee balance economic development with environmental stewardship. The tribe operates gaming (Menominee Casino Resort), forestry, and other enterprises. The sustainable forestry operation continues producing timber while maintaining forest health. Language revitalization works urgently; the Menominee Language and Culture Commission coordinates efforts. The College of Menominee Nation provides higher education emphasizing sustainability. Environmental concerns extend beyond the forest—the tribe fights pollution from upstream mining. How the Menominee maintain their pioneering sustainable forestry model while addressing economic needs and language preservation shapes this ancient people's future.</p>
