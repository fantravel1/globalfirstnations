            <h2>Who Are the Amis?</h2>
            <p>The Amis (Pangcah, 阿美族) are the largest indigenous group in Taiwan, numbering approximately 210,000-220,000 people. They speak Amis, a Formosan language of the Austronesian family, with several dialect groups. The Amis traditionally inhabited the east coast of Taiwan, from Hualien to Taitung, along the Pacific coast and the East Rift Valley. Their territory included both coastal and alluvial plain environments. Amis society is distinctively organized around age-grade systems, with elaborate ceremonies marking transitions between grades. They are known for their vibrant harvest festivals, colorful traditional dress, and musical traditions that have influenced Taiwanese popular culture.</p>

            <h2>Age-Grade System</h2>
            <p>Amis society is organized around a sophisticated age-grade (kapot) system that structures social life, particularly for men. Males progress through named age-grades, each with specific responsibilities and privileges. The youngest grades perform community service; middle grades constitute the working force; elder grades hold authority and make decisions. Initiation ceremonies mark transitions between grades. This system provides governance, organizes labor for collective projects, and transmits knowledge across generations. The age-grade system has weakened with modernization but remains culturally significant, particularly in festival contexts where age-grade songs and dances are performed.</p>

            <h2>Ilisin Harvest Festival</h2>
            <p>The Ilisin (harvest festival) is the Amis' most important annual ceremony, celebrated in July-August after the millet harvest. Each village holds its own Ilisin, lasting from three to seven days. The festival features elaborate dances, songs, and ceremonies organized by age-grade. Distinctive circle dances with joined hands are performed to specific songs. Participants wear traditional dress—women in embroidered skirts and headbands, men in various ceremonial attire. The Ilisin reinforces community solidarity, confirms age-grade transitions, and thanks the spirits for the harvest. These festivals have become tourist attractions while retaining ceremonial significance for Amis communities.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Amis</h2>
            <p>Modern Amis are among Taiwan's most visible indigenous peoples. Their music has influenced mainstream Taiwanese pop; singers like A-Mei (Zhang Huimei) and Suming are well-known nationally. Amis language faces pressures from Mandarin, though revitalization efforts continue. Many Amis work in construction, fishing, and urban service industries; migration to cities like Taipei has dispersed the community. Traditional land has faced development pressure. Taiwan's Indigenous Peoples Basic Law provides protections, and indigenous affairs have gained political attention. How the Amis maintain cultural distinctiveness—particularly the age-grade system and festival traditions—while their youth integrate into modern Taiwan shapes this largest indigenous nation's future.</p>
