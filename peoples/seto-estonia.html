            <h2>Who Are the Seto?</h2>
            <p>The Seto (Setu) are a Finno-Ugric people numbering approximately 10,000-13,000, historically inhabiting the border region between Estonia and Russia (Setomaa—"land of the Seto"). They speak Seto, classified as either a dialect of Estonian or a distinct South Estonian language, and traditionally practiced Russian Orthodox Christianity (unlike Lutheran Estonians)—a distinction that shaped their unique cultural identity. The Seto are renowned for their polyphonic singing tradition (leelo), distinctive folk costume, and cultural resilience despite their homeland being divided by the Estonian-Russian border since 1991. They represent a small European indigenous community fighting to preserve their heritage.</p>

            <h2>Leelo Singing</h2>
            <p>Leelo is the Seto polyphonic singing tradition—recognized by UNESCO as Intangible Cultural Heritage. A lead singer (torrõ) improvises verses while a chorus responds with a unique drone-like bass voice (killõ) and other parts. The sound is distinct and ancient—some scholars see connections to pre-Christian ritual music. Leelo accompanies all aspects of life: work, weddings, funerals, and festivals. The tradition was suppressed during Soviet times but survived through dedicated practitioners. Contemporary Seto have revitalized leelo through choirs, festivals, and teaching programs. Leelo represents both Seto identity and an irreplaceable musical heritage.</p>

            <h2>Divided Homeland</h2>
            <p>The 1991 restoration of Estonian independence left most of historic Setomaa in Russia (now Pskov Oblast). The border split communities, separating families and villages. Most Seto chose Estonian citizenship and moved west; those remaining in Russia face assimilation pressure. This division threatens cultural continuity—sacred sites, cemeteries, and communities now lie across an international border. Estonian Seto maintain connections to Pechory Monastery (Russia's oldest and a Seto spiritual center) through special visa arrangements. The situation demonstrates how modern borders can fragment small indigenous communities whose territories were drawn without their consultation.</p>

            <h2>Cultural Revival</h2>
            <p>Since Estonian independence, Seto cultural revival has been remarkable. The Seto Congress meets annually; the Seto Kingdom Day (first Saturday of August) includes elections of a "King" (Ülembsootska) and cultural celebrations. Museums preserve material culture; language documentation and education programs support Seto maintenance. Young people learn leelo; traditional costume-making continues. European Union support for cross-border cooperation has helped maintain connections across the Estonian-Russian divide. Yet challenges remain: small population, aging speakers, and limited institutional support threaten long-term survival. The Seto revival demonstrates both possibilities and limits of European minority cultural preservation.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Seto</h2>
            <p>Modern Seto navigate multiple identities: Estonian citizens, Orthodox Christians in a secular society, speakers of an endangered language, members of a divided community. Most live outside historic Setomaa—in Tallinn and other cities—maintaining identity through cultural organizations, festivals, and return visits. Tourism to Setomaa brings economic opportunities and risks of commodification. Relations with Russia remain complicated by the border and political tensions. How the Seto maintain distinct identity while integrating into European society, preserve language and tradition with a small population, and address the divided homeland defines their contemporary challenges as one of Europe's smallest indigenous peoples.</p>
