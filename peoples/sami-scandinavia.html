            <h2>Who Are the Sami?</h2>
            <p>The Sami are the indigenous people of Sápmi, a cultural region spanning northern Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia's Kola Peninsula. As Europe's only officially recognized indigenous people, the approximately 80,000-100,000 Sami have inhabited Arctic Scandinavia for at least 5,000 years. Famous for reindeer herding, distinctive clothing, and the joik vocal tradition, the Sami have fought long battles for recognition and rights while maintaining cultural traditions in one of the world's wealthiest regions.</p>

            <h2>Reindeer Herding</h2>
            <p>Reindeer herding defines Sami identity even though only about 10% of Sami actively herd today. Sami reindeer are semi-domesticated, ranging freely across vast territories while herders follow and manage them through seasonal migrations between coastal and inland pastures. Each reindeer is individually owned, identified by distinctive ear notches. Herding rights are legally protected in Norway and Sweden, restricted to Sami families with herding traditions. Modern herders use snowmobiles and helicopters alongside traditional methods, adapting ancient practices to contemporary conditions.</p>

            <h2>Joik: The Indigenous Music</h2>
            <p>The joik is a unique Sami vocal tradition—not a song about something but a song that is something. A joik captures the essence of a person, animal, or place rather than describing it. Each person may have their own joik, composed spontaneously at birth or another significant moment. Joiking was suppressed by Christian missionaries who considered it shamanic and sinful. The tradition survived underground and has experienced revival, with contemporary artists fusing traditional joik with modern genres. UNESCO recognizes joik as intangible cultural heritage.</p>

            <h2>Gákti: Traditional Dress</h2>
            <p>The gákti is the traditional Sami costume, with distinctive regional variations in colors, patterns, and accessories that identify the wearer's community and family origins. Made of wool or reindeer hide, gákti are worn for ceremonies, celebrations, and important occasions. Details like buttons, embroidery, and belt decorations convey information about marital status and origin. Creating a gákti requires significant skill and knowledge passed through generations. Young Sami increasingly wear gákti for graduations, weddings, and cultural events, asserting identity in contemporary contexts.</p>

            <h2>Rights Struggles and Victories</h2>
            <p>The Sami faced centuries of assimilation policies—children sent to boarding schools, language suppressed, traditional practices discouraged. Since the 1970s, Sami political activism has achieved significant gains: Sami parliaments in Norway, Sweden, and Finland advise governments on Sami affairs; languages receive official protection; and land and resource rights are increasingly recognized. The 2020 Swedish case Girjas confirmed Sami exclusive hunting and fishing rights on traditional lands. Climate change now threatens reindeer herding as warming alters vegetation and ice conditions, creating new challenges for Arctic indigenous life.</p>
