            <h2>Who Are the Cornish?</h2>
            <p>The Cornish (Kernowyon) are a Celtic people indigenous to Cornwall (Kernow), the peninsula at the southwestern tip of England. The population of Cornwall is approximately 570,000. They speak Cornish (Kernewek), a Brythonic Celtic language closely related to Welsh and Breton. Cornish was spoken continuously from ancient times until the late 18th century when it died as a community language—the "last native speaker," Dolly Pentreath, died in 1777. However, the language has been revived since the early 20th century, with approximately 3,000-5,000 speakers today. In 2014, the UK government officially recognized the Cornish as a national minority under European frameworks. Cornwall's identity is shaped by Celtic heritage, tin mining history, distinct landscape, and growing cultural assertiveness.</p>

            <h2>Celtic Roots</h2>
            <p>Cornwall was part of the Brythonic Celtic world that covered Britain before Anglo-Saxon invasion. When Anglo-Saxons conquered most of England, Cornwall remained Celtic—the boundary between "English" and "West Welsh" (as the English called Cornish speakers) was fixed at the Tamar River by the 9th century. Cornwall was eventually absorbed into England but maintained distinctive identity. The Cornish language survived, related to Welsh (with which it shares distant mutual intelligibility) and especially to Breton (Cornish and Breton speakers maintained contact across the Channel). Place names throughout Cornwall—Penzance, Truro, Fowey—are Cornish, as are many surnames. Saints' cults, holy wells, and stone crosses mark the Cornish Christian landscape. The distinctive Cornish cross (with its circular ring) appears throughout the region.</p>

            <h2>Mining Heritage</h2>
            <p>Tin and copper mining defined Cornwall for millennia. Tin was exported to the Mediterranean in ancient times; medieval Cornwall was Europe's major tin source. The 18th-19th century mining boom made Cornwall a world center of industrial revolution technology—Cornish engineers developed steam engines (Richard Trevithick built early steam locomotives), pumping systems, and mining techniques exported globally. Cornish miners emigrated worldwide—to America, Australia, South Africa, Mexico—taking their expertise and culture. "Cousin Jacks" (Cornish miners abroad) established communities on several continents. When mines closed in the late 19th-20th century, Cornwall became economically depressed. The mining landscape is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Mining vocabulary, pasties (the miners' traditional lunch), and mining heritage remain central to Cornish identity.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Cornish</h2>
            <p>Modern Cornwall navigates between cultural revival and economic challenges. The Cornish language, revived through dedicated efforts, now has hundreds of fluent speakers and thousands of learners; it's taught in some schools and appears on bilingual signs. Cornish cultural festivals, particularly Gorsedh Kernow (modeled on Welsh and Breton bardic institutions), celebrate poetry and music. The St. Piran's Day (March 5) flag (white cross on black) has become a powerful symbol. Economically, Cornwall remains one of England's poorest regions, heavily dependent on tourism and seasonal employment. Affordable housing is a crisis as second homes and retirees price out locals. The "Cornish Assembly" movement seeks devolution. Cornish identity is strengthening—surveys show most residents identify as Cornish rather than (or as well as) English. Whether this cultural revival translates into political recognition beyond minority status remains to be seen.</p>
