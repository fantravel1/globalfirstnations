            <h2>Who Are the Moken?</h2>
            <p>The Moken are a seminomadic Austronesian people who have lived on the waters of the Andaman Sea for thousands of years, ranging across the islands between Myanmar (Burma) and Thailand. Known as "sea gypsies" or "sea nomads," they traditionally spent most of their lives aboard houseboats called kabang, coming ashore only during monsoon season. Their intimate knowledge of the sea, extraordinary diving abilities, and unique adaptations to marine life make them one of the world's most remarkable maritime cultures.</p>

            </div>

            <h2>Life on the Kabang</h2>
            <p>The kabang, a wooden houseboat typically 6-9 meters long, served as the Moken's floating home, vehicle, and identity. Entire families—parents, children, grandparents—lived aboard, with the boat's deck serving as living space, its interior for storage and sleeping during rough weather. Kabang were built entirely by hand from a single large tree, requiring months of skilled labor and representing family wealth and status.</p>
            <p>Moken moved between islands following fish migrations, sea cucumber seasons, and weather patterns. They possessed encyclopedic knowledge of currents, tides, and marine ecosystems across hundreds of islands. Navigation was accomplished without instruments, using wave patterns, bird behavior, and ancestral knowledge passed down through oral traditions. A skilled Moken navigator could sail through their territory in complete darkness.</p>

            <h2>Superhuman Underwater Vision</h2>
            <p>Scientific research has confirmed what Moken have long known: their children possess remarkable underwater vision, able to see clearly at depths where others see only blur. Studies by Anna Gislén of Lund University showed Moken children can constrict their pupils and adjust their lens shape to compensate for water's different refraction—an ability previously thought impossible in humans. This allows them to spot tiny shellfish and sea cucumbers on the ocean floor with extraordinary precision.</p>
            <p>This adaptation develops in early childhood through constant practice. Moken children begin diving alongside parents as toddlers, spending hours daily underwater gathering food. Their bodies adapt: beyond improved vision, they develop enlarged spleens that release extra oxygen-carrying blood cells during dives, and exceptional breath-holding capacity. These traits demonstrate human physiological plasticity when lifestyle demands aquatic adaptation.</p>

            <h2>Tsunami Survival and Sea Knowledge</h2>
            <p>The Moken gained worldwide attention following the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. While over 200,000 people died across the region, Moken communities suffered almost no casualties. Elders recognized warning signs—unusual wave patterns, fleeing fish, strange animal behavior—and led their people to high ground before the waves arrived. Their oral traditions included stories of "the wave that eats people," preserving knowledge of past tsunamis across generations.</p>
            <p>This survival demonstrates the value of traditional ecological knowledge. The Moken's intimate relationship with the sea, accumulated over millennia, provided life-saving warnings that modern technology failed to deliver. Their story became a powerful example of indigenous wisdom's contemporary relevance.</p>

            <h2>Spiritual Beliefs</h2>
            <p>Moken spirituality centers on spirits inhabiting the natural world—particularly the sea, islands, and ancestral kabang. The most important ceremony is the Loy Ruea festival, held at the start of calm season, featuring the construction of a spirit boat laden with offerings set adrift to carry away bad luck and disease. Shamans communicate with spirits, heal the sick, and interpret dreams and omens guiding community decisions.</p>
            <p>The sea itself is considered a living entity deserving respect. Elaborate taboos govern fishing practices, diving behavior, and waste disposal. Violations risk angering sea spirits, bringing storms, illness, or failed catches. This spiritual ecology promotes sustainable resource use—taking only what's needed and maintaining the ocean's health for future generations.</p>

            <h2>Threats to Survival</h2>
            <p>The Moken way of life faces existential threats. National boundaries between Myanmar and Thailand have complicated traditional movements across their maritime territory. Marine protected areas restrict fishing grounds. The 2004 tsunami displaced many Moken into government-built settlements, separating them from the sea. Children attend schools that teach national languages rather than Moken, and many youth leave for wage labor in tourism or fishing industries.</p>
            <p>Climate change alters the ecosystems they depend upon, while overfishing by commercial fleets depletes resources. Perhaps most critically, the kabang-building tradition is dying—few young Moken learn the skills, and the large trees required become ever scarcer. Without kabang, the Moken's identity as sea nomads cannot survive. Conservation efforts now focus on protecting both the marine environment and the cultural practices that sustained it for millennia.</p>
