            <h2>Who Are the Khanty?</h2>
            <p>The Khanty (historically known as Ostyaks) are a Uralic people of Western Siberia, inhabiting the vast taiga and tundra along the Ob River and its tributaries in the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug. Numbering approximately 31,000, they speak Khanty, a Uralic language related to Hungarian and Finnish but separated by millennia of divergent development. The Khanty developed diverse subsistence adaptations: fishing along the Ob, reindeer herding in the north, and hunting throughout their territory. Their elaborate bear ceremony represented one of the most complex ritual systems in northern Eurasia. Today, Khanty territories contain some of Russia's largest oil and gas deposits, creating dramatic conflicts between traditional lifeways and industrial extraction.</p>

            <h2>Ob River Fishermen</h2>
            <p>The Ob River, one of the world's longest, provided the foundation for traditional Khanty life. Massive fish runs—sturgeon, nelma, muksun, and other species—supplied protein and trade goods. Khanty developed sophisticated fishing technology: weirs, traps, nets, and hooks suited to different species and seasons. Fish camps along the Ob and its tributaries served as seasonal gathering places. Fish were preserved through smoking, drying, and freezing for year-round consumption. The Ob also served as the primary transportation route: dugout boats in summer, frozen river highways in winter. Northern Khanty adopted reindeer herding from neighboring Nenets, adding another dimension to their economy. This mixed economy—fishing, hunting, and herding—allowed adaptation to the varied environments of the Ob basin.</p>

            <h2>Bear Ceremony</h2>
            <p>The Khanty Bear Festival (similar to Mansi traditions) was among the most elaborate in northern Eurasia. Bears were considered sacred ancestors or messengers between human and spirit worlds. When a bear was killed, an elaborate multi-day ceremony followed. The bear's skull was decorated and honored; masked performances, songs, and rituals addressed the bear's spirit, apologizing for the killing and sending it honorably to the spirit world. Different clans maintained different bear-related traditions and songs. The ceremony included theatrical performances, some satirical, that commented on social life. Soviet authorities suppressed bear ceremonies as "shamanism," but underground practice continued. Post-Soviet revival has restored some ceremonies, though much knowledge was lost.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Khanty</h2>
            <p>Modern Khanty face dramatic challenges from oil and gas extraction. The Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug contains approximately 50% of Russia's oil production; extraction has devastated traditional territories through pollution, road construction, and pipeline development. Sacred sites have been destroyed; fish populations have declined; reindeer pastures have been fragmented. Some Khanty families have received compensation; others continue to resist development. Those maintaining traditional activities face increasing difficulty accessing territories and resources. The Khanty language is endangered; transmission to children has declined. Cultural institutions in Khanty-Mansiysk preserve and promote heritage. Some Khanty have become activists, documenting environmental damage and advocating for indigenous rights. The Khanty situation exemplifies the conflicts between indigenous peoples and resource extraction across the Arctic and subarctic.</p>
