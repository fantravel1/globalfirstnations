            <h2>Who Are the Tangkhul?</h2>
            <p>The Tangkhul are a Tibeto-Burman ethnic group and the largest Naga tribe in Manipur state, India, numbering approximately 180,000-200,000. They speak Tangkhul, a Tibeto-Burman language with significant dialectal variation. The Tangkhul inhabit the Ukhrul district in the hills of northern Manipur, adjacent to Myanmar. Their territory is known for the Shirui Lily, a rare flower found only on Shirui Peak. Though Naga by identity, the Tangkhul are administratively part of Manipur rather than Nagaland, creating unique political dynamics. Most Tangkhul are Christians, predominantly Baptist, following missionary activity in the early 20th century.</p>

            <h2>Naga Identity in Manipur</h2>
            <p>The Tangkhul occupy a unique position as Nagas within Manipur rather than Nagaland. When Nagaland was created in 1963, Manipur's Naga-majority hill districts remained separate. This has created ongoing tensions: many Tangkhul support integration of Naga areas across state boundaries, while Meitei-majority Manipur resists territorial changes. The Tangkhul have been active in Naga nationalist movements, with some groups involved in insurgency. Balancing Naga identity with Manipur citizenship creates complex political navigation. The Tangkhul are the largest of several Naga tribes in Manipur, including the Maring, Mao, and Poumai.</p>

            <h2>Cultural Traditions</h2>
            <p>Tangkhul culture features rich textile traditions, with distinctive shawls and wraparound garments marking clan and status. The Luira Phanit, a seed-sowing festival, celebrates agricultural cycles with traditional dances and songs. The Thisam, a harvest festival, marks the gathering of crops. Traditional Tangkhul villages featured the long (men's dormitory) where young men learned cultural traditions and martial skills. Oral literature, including creation myths and heroic epics, preserves historical memory. These traditions continue in adapted forms, coexisting with Christian practice. Cultural festivals have become occasions for expressing Tangkhul identity.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Tangkhul</h2>
            <p>Modern Tangkhul face the challenge of maintaining identity amid complex political environments. Education has produced professionals working throughout India. Agriculture, particularly rice and orchard crops, remains important in the hills. Ukhrul town has grown as an administrative center. The Shirui Lily festival attracts tourists, promoting the region's natural heritage. Political engagement spans state and national politics as well as Naga nationalist movements. Youth navigate between traditional identity, Christian values, and modern aspirations. How the Tangkhul balance Naga solidarity with Manipur citizenship while preserving cultural heritage shapes this hill people's evolving future.</p>
