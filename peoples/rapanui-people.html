            <h2>Who Are the Rapanui?</h2>
            <p>The Rapanui are the indigenous Polynesian people of Rapa Nui (Easter Island), one of the world's most isolated inhabited islands, located in the southeastern Pacific Ocean over 2,000 miles from Chile (which administers it) and the nearest Polynesian islands. Today numbering approximately 5,000-6,000 (about 60% of the island's population), they speak Rapanui, an Eastern Polynesian language. The Rapanui are famous for creating the moai—the monumental stone statues that have made Easter Island one of the world's most iconic archaeological sites. Their history has been subject to intense debate about collapse, resilience, and colonialism.</p>

            <h2>The Moai Civilization</h2>
            <p>Rapanui ancestors, arriving around 1200 CE, developed one of Polynesia's most distinctive cultures. They carved nearly 900 moai—stone statues averaging 13 feet tall and 14 tons, with some reaching 33 feet and 82 tons—from volcanic rock at Rano Raraku quarry. These statues, representing deified ancestors, were transported miles to ceremonial platforms (ahu) ringing the coast. The engineering achievement remains impressive—theories about how statues were moved range from wooden sledges to "walking" them upright using ropes. The island also produced rongorongo, a script that remains undeciphered, possibly one of few independent inventions of writing. Traditional society was organized into clans with a paramount chief and elaborate ritual systems.</p>

            <h2>Collapse and Colonial Contact</h2>
            <p>The popular narrative of Easter Island "collapse"—often blamed on environmental destruction by the Rapanui themselves—has been challenged by recent scholarship. Environmental degradation (deforestation, partly caused by introduced rats eating palm seeds) occurred, but the population remained substantial until European contact. It was colonialism that devastated the Rapanui: Peruvian slave raids in 1862-1863 captured over a third of the population; survivors brought smallpox and tuberculosis that killed most of the remainder. By 1877, only 111 Rapanui survived. Chilean annexation in 1888 brought further exploitation—the entire island was leased for sheep ranching, and Rapanui were confined to a small area. This near-genocide, not pre-contact collapse, explains the culture's disruption.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Rapanui</h2>
            <p>Modern Rapanui have experienced remarkable revival despite historical trauma. The population has recovered; the Rapanui language has been revitalized and is taught in schools; traditional arts including carving, tattooing, and performance flourish. The annual Tapati Rapa Nui festival celebrates culture through traditional competitions and performances. Tourism to the UNESCO World Heritage site provides economic opportunities but creates tensions over development and cultural authenticity. Rapanui activists have sought greater autonomy from Chile and control over their heritage, including the return of artifacts from museums worldwide. Land rights remain contested. The Rapanui demonstrate indigenous resilience—how near-extinction can be followed by cultural renaissance—while navigating the challenges of being an iconic but colonized people.</p>
