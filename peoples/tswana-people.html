            <h2>Who Are the Tswana?</h2>
            <p>The Tswana (Batswana) are a Bantu-speaking people of Southern Africa, numbering approximately 5-6 million across Botswana (where they form the majority), South Africa (where they are one of the largest ethnic groups), Namibia, and Zimbabwe. They speak Setswana, a Bantu language and one of South Africa's eleven official languages. The Tswana developed distinctive political institutions, particularly the kgotla (public meeting place) where community decisions were made through discussion and consensus. Their territory gave its name to Botswana ("land of the Tswana"), one of Africa's most stable and prosperous democracies, though Tswana-speaking peoples extend well beyond its borders.</p>

            <h2>Political Institutions</h2>
            <p>Traditional Tswana society was organized into chiefdoms (merafe, singular morafe) led by hereditary chiefs (dikgosi, singular kgosi). Crucially, chiefly power was balanced by the kgotla—the public assembly where all adult men could speak and community decisions were reached through discussion. The proverb "kgosi ke kgosi ka batho" (a chief is a chief through his people) captured this consultative principle. Chiefs ruled with councils of advisors, and unpopular chiefs could be deposed. This system—sometimes called "Tswana democracy"—impressed European observers and influenced Botswana's post-independence governance, which retained elements of traditional consultation. Large stone-walled towns characterized Tswana settlement, unlike the scattered homesteads of some Bantu-speaking peoples.</p>

            <h2>Economy and Society</h2>
            <p>Traditional Tswana economy combined cattle herding (the foundation of wealth and status), agriculture (primarily sorghum and later maize), hunting, and trade. Cattle held social and ritual significance beyond economics—paid as bride wealth (bogadi), sacrificed at important ceremonies, and serving as markers of status. Social organization was patrilineal, with inheritance and succession through male lines. Initiation schools (bogwera for boys, bojale for girls) prepared youth for adulthood. Religion centered on ancestor veneration and belief in Modimo (God/supreme being). The 19th century brought profound changes—missionary Christianity spread widely, the difaqane (migrations sparked by Zulu expansion) disrupted societies, and British protection (later colonization) of Bechuanaland altered political structures.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Tswana</h2>
            <p>Modern Tswana experience varies between Botswana and South Africa. In Botswana, Tswana culture is national culture—Setswana is the national language, traditional institutions retain significant social authority, and kgotla continues as a community institution. Botswana's diamond-funded prosperity has brought development, though San minorities face marginalization. In South Africa, apartheid-era Bantustans (Bophuthatswana) forced artificial political separation; post-apartheid integration has changed political frameworks while Tswana identity persists. Setswana remains widely spoken and taught. Traditional leadership continues, though adapted to constitutional democracies. Cattle herding maintains cultural importance even as urbanization accelerates. The Tswana demonstrate how indigenous political traditions can inform modern governance, though inequalities persist within and between Tswana-speaking populations.</p>
