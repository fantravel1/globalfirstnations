            <h2>Who Are the Nenets?</h2>
            <p>The Nenets are an indigenous Samoyedic people of the Russian Arctic, inhabiting the vast Yamal and Gydan peninsulas stretching from the White Sea to the Yenisei River. They are the world's largest nomadic reindeer herding population, with some families migrating over 1,000 kilometers annually following their herds across the frozen tundra. In one of Earth's harshest environments, the Nenets have thrived for thousands of years through remarkable adaptation and intimate knowledge of their landscape.</p>

            <h2>Reindeer: Life and Livelihood</h2>
            <p>For the Nenets, reindeer are everything—transportation, food, clothing, shelter, and spiritual connection. A family's wealth is measured in reindeer, with successful herders owning thousands. The animals provide meat for sustenance, hides for clothing and tent covers, sinew for thread, and bones for tools. Reindeer pull sleds across the snow and serve as pack animals in summer. The Nenets maintain an intimate relationship with their herds, recognizing individual animals and understanding their behavior through generations of accumulated knowledge.</p>

            <h2>The Chum: Mobile Arctic Home</h2>
            <p>The chum is the traditional Nenets dwelling—a conical tent covered with reindeer hides that can be assembled or dismantled in under an hour. Designed for the nomadic lifestyle, the chum's structure allows heat from the central fire to circulate while snow slides off the steep sides. Inside, reindeer hides provide insulation from the frozen ground. The placement of family members within the chum follows strict tradition, with the sacred area opposite the entrance reserved for spiritual practices and honored guests.</p>

            <h2>Surviving Extreme Cold</h2>
            <p>The Nenets have developed sophisticated clothing technologies for surviving temperatures below -50°C. Their malitsa is a hooded coat made from young reindeer hide worn fur-side in, while the outer gus reverses this arrangement. Together these layers create exceptional insulation. Reindeer-hide boots (pimy) keep feet warm on frozen ground. Women's clothing features distinctive colorful decorations and different cuts than men's garments. This clothing technology, refined over millennia, surpasses modern synthetic alternatives in extreme cold.</p>

            <h2>Climate Change and Gas Extraction</h2>
            <p>The Nenets face dual threats from climate change and industrial development. Warming temperatures cause unpredictable ice conditions, thawing permafrost, and changes in vegetation that affect reindeer migration. Massive natural gas extraction projects on Yamal Peninsula fragment migration routes and compete for land. Some Nenets have adapted by incorporating snowmobiles alongside traditional reindeer sleds. Despite pressures, many families maintain nomadic traditions, viewing their lifestyle not as hardship but as freedom and connection to ancestral ways.</p>
