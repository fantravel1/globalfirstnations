            <h2>Who Are the Nenets?</h2>
            <p>The Nenets are an Arctic indigenous people numbering approximately 45,000, inhabiting the vast tundra stretching from the Kola Peninsula to the Yenisei River in northern Russia—over 1,000 kilometers of Arctic territory. They speak Nenets (Tundra Nenets and Forest Nenets varieties), a Samoyedic language. The Nenets are the world's largest remaining nomadic reindeer herding culture, maintaining seasonal migrations of 1,000+ kilometers with herds of thousands of animals. While most indigenous peoples have abandoned traditional nomadism, many Nenets continue—moving with reindeer across tundra from winter pastures to summer grounds, living in chum (conical tents), following patterns established over millennia.</p>

            <h2>Reindeer Herding</h2>
            <p>Nenets reindeer herding is among the world's most extensive—some families manage herds of 10,000+ animals, migrating seasonally between winter forest edges and summer coastal tundra. Reindeer provide everything: meat, hides for clothing and shelter, transport (sled teams), milk, and bone for tools. The Nenets developed sophisticated knowledge of reindeer behavior, tundra ecology, weather, and navigation across seemingly featureless landscape. Large-scale herding emerged relatively recently (18th-19th centuries); Soviet collectivization disrupted but didn't eliminate nomadism. Today, an estimated 5,000-10,000 Nenets remain fully nomadic—one of the world's last large nomadic populations.</p>

            <h2>Gas and Oil</h2>
            <p>Nenets territory overlies some of Russia's largest gas and oil reserves. The Yamal Peninsula—heart of Nenets land—hosts massive extraction operations. Pipelines, roads, and industrial installations fragment migration routes; pollution affects pastures; workers and alcohol bring social disruption. The Nenets have limited power to resist development on land they don't legally own. Some benefit from compensation payments or employment; others face pasture loss without recourse. The Russian government prioritizes extraction over indigenous rights. How Nenets adapt to industrial intrusion while maintaining herding—or whether they can—tests the compatibility of Arctic development and indigenous survival.</p>

            <h2>Climate Change</h2>
            <p>Arctic warming directly affects Nenets life. Rain-on-snow events (increasingly common) freeze over tundra vegetation, preventing reindeer from reaching food—causing mass starvation. Permafrost thaw makes terrain unstable. Earlier springs and later winters disrupt migration timing. Unpredictable weather challenges traditional knowledge. Anthrax outbreaks (from thawing permafrost releasing spores) have killed reindeer and infected herders. The Nenets, having contributed nothing to climate change, face its most immediate Arctic impacts. Their traditional ecological knowledge may help understand changes, but adapting to conditions never before experienced challenges even their resilience.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Nenets</h2>
            <p>Modern Nenets exist in two worlds: nomadic herders maintaining traditional life, and settled communities in towns facing typical post-Soviet challenges. Boarding schools separate children from herding families—some never return to nomadism; others alternate between worlds. The Nenets Autonomous Okrug provides some self-governance, but Moscow controls resources. Cultural revival efforts preserve language (still spoken by children in herding families), traditional crafts, and knowledge. How Nenets maintain nomadic herding amid industrial development, climate change, and Russian state control—and whether the next generation will choose this demanding life—defines their uncertain future.</p>
