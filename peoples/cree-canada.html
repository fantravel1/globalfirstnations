            <h2>Who Are the Cree?</h2>
            <p>The Cree (Nehiyawak in their language) are the largest First Nations group in Canada, with approximately 350,000 members across a vast territory stretching from Alberta to Quebec. They speak Cree (Nehiyawewin), an Algonquian language with multiple dialects and distinctive syllabic writing. Historically, Cree were central to the fur trade, serving as middlemen between European traders and interior peoples. Their territory spans boreal forest and subarctic regions, supporting traditional hunting, trapping, and fishing economies. Today, Cree nations exercise various degrees of self-governance, with some communities having negotiated landmark land claims and governance agreements.</p>

            <h2>Fur Trade History</h2>
            <p>The Cree were strategic players in the North American fur trade (1600s-1800s). Their location between Hudson's Bay Company posts and interior territories positioned them as essential middlemen and trappers. The fur trade transformed Cree society—introducing firearms, metal tools, and new trade goods while intensifying trapping. Some Cree bands expanded into former rivals' territories. Métis people emerged from unions between Cree women and European traders. When the fur trade declined, Cree faced difficult transitions. This history shapes contemporary Cree identity: sophisticated trading, adaptation, and relationships with outsiders characterize their historical experience.</p>

            <h2>James Bay Agreement</h2>
            <p>The James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement (1975) was Canada's first modern land claims agreement, negotiated when Quebec proposed massive hydroelectric development (James Bay Project) on Cree and Inuit lands. The Cree Grand Council, led by Billy Diamond, negotiated compensation, land rights, and self-governance provisions. The agreement was controversial—some saw it as selling birthright; others as pragmatic adaptation. Subsequent agreements have strengthened Cree governance. The Cree-Naskapi Act (1984) provided unique self-governance. These agreements make Quebec Cree among Canada's most autonomous First Nations, with significant economic resources and political power.</p>

            <h2>Cree Communities Today</h2>
            <p>Modern Cree communities vary dramatically—from isolated fly-in reserves to communities adjacent to major cities. Some retain traditional economies (hunting, trapping, fishing); others are fully integrated into wage economies. Language retention varies: some communities maintain strong Cree; others face language shift to English/French. The Cree syllabary, developed by missionary James Evans (1840s) and adapted by Cree, remains in use. Cultural practices—ceremonies, gatherings, traditional knowledge—persist alongside modern life. Challenges include housing shortages, health disparities, suicide crises, and the legacy of residential schools that separated children from families and culture.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Cree Issues</h2>
            <p>Modern Cree navigate resource development (mining, forestry, hydroelectric) on traditional territories—sometimes opposing, sometimes negotiating benefits agreements. Climate change affects boreal ecosystems central to Cree livelihoods. Self-governance negotiations continue; some Cree nations have achieved significant autonomy while others remain under Indian Act constraints. Missing and murdered Indigenous women affect Cree communities. Truth and reconciliation processes address residential school trauma. How Cree balance economic development with environmental and cultural protection, while strengthening governance and healing from historical trauma, defines their contemporary path.</p>
