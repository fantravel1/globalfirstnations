            <h2>Who Are the Cree?</h2>
            <p>The Cree (Nehiyawak) are one of the largest Indigenous nations in North America, with over 350,000 members spread across Canada from Quebec to Alberta, and into Montana in the United States. Speaking dialects of the Cree language—part of the Algonquian family—the Cree historically inhabited the boreal forest and subarctic regions, developing sophisticated adaptations to the northern environment. Today, Cree nations range from the James Bay Cree of Quebec to the Plains Cree of Saskatchewan, united by language and culture while maintaining regional distinctiveness.</p>

            <h2>Cree Syllabics</h2>
            <p>In the 1840s, Methodist missionary James Evans, working with Cree speakers, developed the Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics—a writing system where each symbol represents a consonant-vowel combination. The system spread rapidly, with Cree people teaching each other to read without missionary intermediaries. Syllabics remain widely used, appearing on signage, in publications, and on social media. The writing system was later adapted for Inuktitut, Ojibwe, and other languages, becoming a pan-Indigenous literacy tool across subarctic Canada.</p>

            <h2>The Fur Trade Era</h2>
            <p>Cree people became central players in the fur trade that shaped Canadian history. As middlemen between European traders and interior nations, the Cree expanded their territory and influence dramatically. Trade relationships were governed by Cree protocols of gift-giving, kinship, and reciprocity—which Europeans often failed to understand. While the fur trade brought material goods, it also brought disease, dependency, and eventual marginalization. Yet Cree people adapted, maintaining identity through centuries of colonial pressure.</p>

            <h2>James Bay: Fighting Hydro-Power</h2>
            <p>In the 1970s, Quebec announced massive hydroelectric development on James Bay Cree territory without consultation. The Cree, led by young chief Billy Diamond, fought back through courts and international advocacy. The resulting 1975 James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement was Canada's first modern treaty—controversial for its "extinguishment" of aboriginal title but groundbreaking in establishing Cree governance structures and compensation. The Cree continue negotiating, recently securing agreements giving them greater control over development affecting their lands.</p>

            <h2>Spirituality and the Land</h2>
            <p>Cree spirituality emphasizes relationship with the land, animals, and spiritual beings. Hunting is a sacred activity requiring respect for animal spirits—success depends on proper ceremony and gratitude. The shaking tent ceremony connects participants to the spirit world through a specially-constructed lodge. Elders transmit knowledge through oral tradition, and the Cree language itself encodes relationships with the natural world that translation cannot capture. Cultural revitalization efforts emphasize land-based education reconnecting youth with traditional territories.</p>
