            <h2>Who Are the Kabyle?</h2>
            <p>The Kabyle (Iqbayliyen in Kabyle) are a Berber/Amazigh people inhabiting the mountainous Kabylia region of northern Algeria, primarily in the Djurdjura Mountains and surrounding areas east of Algiers. Numbering approximately 6-7 million in Algeria (with significant diaspora, especially in France), they are the largest Berber-speaking group. They speak Kabyle (Taqbaylit), the most widely spoken Northern Berber language. Known for fierce resistance to external rule—from Romans to French colonizers—the Kabyle have maintained distinctive identity while playing leading roles in Algerian nationalism and contemporary movements for Amazigh cultural and political rights.</p>

            <h2>Mountain Resistance</h2>
            <p>The Kabyle have a long history of resistance from their mountain homeland. Roman rule barely penetrated the Djurdjura; Arab conquest was incomplete; Ottoman control remained nominal in mountain villages. French colonial conquest (1830s-1870s) faced fierce Kabyle resistance, particularly the 1871 Mokrani Revolt that took years to suppress. The mountains provided refuge and defense; village assemblies (tajmaɛt) maintained autonomous governance. Paradoxically, French colonization also drew Kabyle into modern education and labor migration; many educated Kabyle became leaders in Algerian nationalism, including anti-colonial figures. This pattern—resistance combined with engagement—characterizes Kabyle history.</p>

            <h2>Berber Spring</h2>
            <p>Following Algerian independence (1962), official policy promoted Arabization, marginalizing Berber languages and identities. Kabyle activists led resistance, culminating in the "Berber Spring" (Tafsut Imazighen) of 1980—protests triggered by cancellation of a lecture on Berber poetry at Tizi Ouzou University. Though suppressed, this movement launched the modern Amazigh cultural movement. Subsequent decades saw continued activism; the 2001 "Black Spring" protests following police killing of a student in Kabylia led to violent clashes and dozens of deaths. In 2002, Tamazight (Berber) became a national language; in 2016, it became an official language of Algeria. These gains, though significant, have not fully satisfied demands for Kabyle autonomy or ended tensions with the Arabizing state.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Kabyle</h2>
            <p>Modern Kabyle identity remains vibrant but contested. Kabylia is economically significant but politically marginalized; demands for regional autonomy face central government opposition. The large diaspora (especially in France, where over a million Kabyle-origin people live) maintains cultural connections while negotiating integration. Kabyle music, particularly chaabi and contemporary fusion artists, has achieved international recognition. Literature in Kabyle has grown, though Arabic and French remain dominant in formal contexts. Religious identity is complex: traditionally Muslim, some Kabyle have converted to Christianity or embrace secularism, creating tensions. The Kabyle represent how indigenous peoples within nation-states struggle for recognition, their movements inspiring Amazigh activism across North Africa.</p>
