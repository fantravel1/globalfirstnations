            <h2>Who Are the Ixil?</h2>
            <p>The Ixil are a Maya people of the Cuchumatanes highlands in the Quiché department of northwestern Guatemala. Numbering approximately 100,000-120,000, they inhabit three main municipalities—Nebaj, Chajul, and San Juan Cotzal—collectively known as the Ixil Triangle. They speak Ixil, a Mayan language in the Greater Mamean branch, related to Mam and Aguacatec. The Ixil region, characterized by rugged mountains and deep valleys, remained relatively isolated until the mid-20th century. This isolation preserved distinctive traditions but also made the region a center of Guatemala's devastating civil war, during which the Ixil suffered some of the worst atrocities documented as genocide.</p>

            <h2>Genocide and Resistance</h2>
            <p>During Guatemala's civil war (1960-1996), the Ixil region became a center of insurgency and military counterinsurgency. The Guerrilla Army of the Poor (EGP) operated in the area; the military responded with scorched-earth campaigns in the early 1980s. Under General Efraín Ríos Montt, the army destroyed dozens of Ixil villages, killed thousands of civilians, and displaced tens of thousands more—actions later determined by Guatemalan courts to constitute genocide. The military viewed the entire Ixil population as guerrilla supporters. Model villages (aldeas modelo) concentrated survivors under military control. In 2013, Ríos Montt became the first former head of state convicted of genocide by his own country's courts (though the verdict was later overturned on procedural grounds). The Ixil experience represents one of the 20th century's most documented indigenous genocides.</p>

            <h2>Women's Weaving</h2>
            <p>Ixil women are renowned weavers, producing huipiles (blouses) featuring distinctive red backgrounds with intricate multicolored brocade designs. Traditional Ixil huipiles are among Guatemala's most elaborate, requiring months of work on backstrap looms. Designs include animals, plants, geometric patterns, and increasingly, motifs commemorating cultural memory and resistance. During the civil war, many women continued weaving in refugee camps and resettlement communities, maintaining cultural identity under extreme conditions. Today, weaving remains central to Ixil women's identity and economy. Cooperatives market textiles internationally, providing income while preserving traditions. The distinctive red color of Ixil textiles has become a symbol of the community's identity and resilience.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Ixil</h2>
            <p>Modern Ixil communities continue recovering from civil war trauma while preserving cultural traditions. The Ixil Triangle remains one of Guatemala's poorest and most marginalized regions, with limited infrastructure, education, and healthcare. Many survivors suffer PTSD; forensic anthropologists continue exhuming mass graves. Yet cultural revitalization has accompanied post-war reconstruction. Traditional ceremonies, suppressed during military occupation, have revived. The Ixil language remains vital; bilingual education programs operate. Young people increasingly organize for human rights, environmental protection, and indigenous autonomy. Tourism, though limited, has grown around cultural experiences and civil war memory sites. The Ixil demonstrate both the devastating costs of political violence against indigenous peoples and the resilience that enables cultural survival.</p>
