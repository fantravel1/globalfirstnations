            <h2>Who Are the Kumandin?</h2>
            <p>The Kumandin are a small indigenous Turkic people of the Altai Krai and parts of Kemerovo Oblast, Russia, numbering approximately 2,800-3,200. They inhabit the lower Biya River valley and adjacent areas in the foothills of the northern Altai. They speak Kumandin, a Turkic language closely related to other Northern Altai languages but considered distinct. Like the Chelkan and Tubalar, the Kumandin were traditionally taiga hunters and gatherers with fishing playing an important role. Russian colonization began early; the Kumandin were among the first Altai peoples to experience Christianization and Russification.</p>

            <h2>Traditional Economy</h2>
            <p>The Kumandin traditional economy combined hunting, fishing, gathering, and small-scale agriculture. The Biya River provided rich fish resources including taimen (a large salmonid), grayling, and other species. Hunting targeted fur-bearers, ungulates, and bears in the surrounding taiga-covered foothills. Pine nut gathering was economically important. Agriculture developed earlier among the Kumandin than neighboring groups due to earlier Russian influence—grain cultivation and livestock keeping supplemented traditional activities. This mixed economy continued into the Soviet period when collectivization organized it into state and collective farms.</p>

            <h2>Early Russification</h2>
            <p>The Kumandin's location at the edge of Russian expansion meant early and intensive contact with colonizers. Orthodox missionaries converted many Kumandin in the 18th and 19th centuries. Russian settlement in the Biya valley was substantial; intermarriage was common. The Kumandin experienced more thorough cultural assimilation than more remote Altai groups. By the late Soviet period, Russian language had largely replaced Kumandin, and many cultural practices had disappeared. This history makes the Kumandin among the most Russified of Altai peoples, with cultural revival facing the challenge of recovering already-disrupted traditions.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Kumandin</h2>
            <p>Modern Kumandin live scattered across the Altai Krai and Kemerovo Oblast, with concentrations in the Solton and Krasnogorsk districts. Most live in mixed Russian-Kumandin villages rather than separate communities. The Kumandin language is critically endangered with perhaps 100-200 speakers, mostly elderly. Russian is the everyday language for nearly all Kumandin. Post-Soviet ethnic recognition established the Kumandin as a protected indigenous small-numbered people. Cultural organizations work to document and revive traditions, but the challenges are severe given the advanced state of assimilation. Whether the Kumandin can maintain distinct ethnic identity or will be absorbed into the Russian population remains an open question.</p>
