            <h2>Who Are the Igbo?</h2>
            <p>The Igbo (also Ibo) are one of Nigeria's three major ethnic groups, numbering approximately 45 million, primarily in southeastern Nigeria. They speak Igbo, a Niger-Congo language with numerous dialects. Unlike centralized kingdoms elsewhere in West Africa, traditional Igbo society was remarkably decentralized—villages governed by councils of elders, title societies, and consensus without kings. This egalitarian tradition fostered individualism, entrepreneurship, and achievement-orientation that characterize Igbo identity today. The Igbo have produced renowned authors (Chinua Achebe), gained global prominence in business and professions, and experienced the trauma of the Biafran War (1967-1970).</p>

            <h2>Decentralized Society</h2>
            <p>Traditional Igbo political organization was distinctively non-hierarchical. Villages were autonomous; councils of elders made decisions by consensus; age-grade societies organized labor and defense; title societies (like ozo) conferred status through achievement rather than birth. The ofo staff symbolized ancestral authority; shrines to chi (personal spirit) reflected religious individualism. This structure puzzled colonial administrators who sought "chiefs" to rule through; the British often imposed unsuitable warrant chiefs. The egalitarian ethos—"Igbo enwe eze" (the Igbo have no king)—shapes contemporary Igbo identity, emphasizing individual achievement over inherited status.</p>

            <h2>Biafra and Trauma</h2>
            <p>The Biafran War (1967-1970) was one of Africa's deadliest conflicts. After pogroms killed thousands of Igbo in northern Nigeria (1966), the Eastern Region seceded as Biafra. Nigeria imposed blockade; an estimated 1-3 million died, mostly from starvation. Biafra's defeat left lasting trauma—loss, marginalization, and the sense that Nigeria failed the Igbo. Post-war, Igbo faced discrimination (the "abandoned property" policy, limited political positions). This history fuels separatist movements (like IPOB—Indigenous People of Biafra); debates about restructuring Nigeria often center on Igbo grievances. Biafra remains a defining Igbo historical memory.</p>

            <h2>Entrepreneurship and Diaspora</h2>
            <p>Igbo are renowned for entrepreneurial success. Trading networks span Nigeria and beyond; apprenticeship systems transmit business knowledge between generations. Aba and Onitsha are major commercial centers. This commercial orientation, combined with emphasis on education, has produced significant professional and business success both in Nigeria and diaspora. Igbo diaspora communities thrive in the United States, UK, and globally—maintaining associations, sending remittances, and engaging with Nigerian politics. The "Igbo apprenticeship system" is studied as a model of indigenous business development. Yet success also generates resentment, contributing to ethnic tensions within Nigeria.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Igbo</h2>
            <p>Modern Igbo navigate Nigeria's complex ethnic politics. Calls for self-determination (from autonomy to outright secession) reflect both historical trauma and current marginalization—no Igbo has been elected Nigerian president since before the war. Religious change has been significant: most Igbo are now Christian (Catholic, Anglican, Pentecostal), while traditional religion survives primarily in ceremonies. Igbo language faces pressure from English; cultural practices like masquerade (mmanwu) continue. Achebe's "Things Fall Apart" remains the most-read African novel, preserving Igbo culture globally. How Igbo relate to Nigerian nationhood while maintaining distinctive identity remains their central political question.</p>
