            <h2>Who Are the Igbo People?</h2>
            <p>The Igbo (also Ibo) are one of Nigeria's three major ethnic groups, with approximately 44 million people primarily inhabiting southeastern Nigeria. They speak Igbo, a Niger-Congo language with numerous dialects. Unlike centralized kingdoms elsewhere in Nigeria, traditional Igbo society was organized through village democracies and achieved hierarchies. The Igbo are renowned for entrepreneurial drive and educational achievement. The attempted secession of Biafra (1967-1970) and subsequent civil war, which killed 1-3 million people (mostly Igbo civilians from starvation), remains the defining trauma of modern Igbo history.</p>

            <h2>Stateless Democracy</h2>
            <p>Traditional Igbo society lacked centralized kings or chiefs—British colonizers famously declared "The Igbo have no kings." Authority resided in village assemblies where all adult males could speak; elders and titled men carried influence but not command. Age-grade systems organized collective labor and defense. Oracles and religious figures provided supernatural arbitration. This decentralized system made Igbo resistant to external control but also complicated colonial administration, which imposed "warrant chiefs" whose authority Igbo communities often rejected. The democratic ethos persists in contemporary Igbo political culture.</p>

            <h2>Achievement Orientation</h2>
            <p>Igbo culture emphasizes personal achievement. Status comes primarily from accomplishment—wealth, education, titles—rather than birth. The ozo title system allowed successful men to purchase prestige through elaborate ceremonies and community contributions. This achievement orientation drove Igbo commercial success throughout Nigeria and beyond. During colonial and post-independence periods, Igbo spread across Nigeria as traders, administrators, and professionals. Their success generated both admiration and resentment from other groups. "Igbo apprenticeship" systems, where young men learn business from successful relatives, continue producing entrepreneurs.</p>

            <h2>The Biafran War</h2>
            <p>In 1966, anti-Igbo pogroms in northern Nigeria killed tens of thousands; millions fled to the southeast. In 1967, the Eastern Region declared independence as the Republic of Biafra under Colonel Ojukwu. The resulting civil war (1967-1970) ended in Biafra's defeat after federal blockade caused massive famine. Estimates of dead range from 1-3 million, mostly Igbo civilians. The war's memory shapes Igbo identity—grievances over the war, its conduct, and subsequent marginalization fuel periodic calls for renewed Biafran independence. The trauma transmits across generations, informing Igbo political consciousness.</p>

            <h2>Global Diaspora</h2>
            <p>Igbo diaspora communities span the globe, from historic communities in the Americas (many African Americans descend from enslaved Igbo) to contemporary professionals in Europe, North America, and beyond. "Igbo Abroad" associations maintain connections to homeland villages, fund development projects, and celebrate Igbo culture. Igbo professionals achieve prominence in medicine, academia, law, and business globally. The diaspora amplifies Igbo political voice—international advocacy for Biafran independence draws on diaspora mobilization. Remittances support families and communities; successful emigrants build houses and sponsor relatives' education.</p>
