            <h2>Who Are the Huli?</h2>
            <p>The Huli are one of the largest indigenous groups in Papua New Guinea, numbering approximately 250,000-300,000 people in the Hela and Southern Highlands Provinces. They speak Huli, a Trans-New Guinea language unrelated to Austronesian coastal languages. The Huli are internationally renowned for their elaborate ceremonial wigs, made from their own hair and decorated with flowers, feathers, and shells. Living in the fertile Tari Basin and surrounding highlands, the Huli developed intensive agriculture and complex social organization featuring compensatory payment systems. Their flamboyant traditional dress and ongoing cultural traditions make them iconic representatives of Papua New Guinea's highland cultures.</p>

            <h2>Wig Culture</h2>
            <p>The ceremonial wigs worn by Huli men are their most distinctive cultural feature. Young men train in traditional bachelor cults where they grow their hair over 18 months while observing taboos designed to strengthen hair growth. The hair is then woven into elaborate wigs, shaped and decorated for ceremonies. Different wig styles indicate status, clan membership, and occasion. Decorations include bird of paradise plumes, cuscus fur, everlasting daisies, and colored clays applied to the face. Wig-making requires specialized knowledge passed through generations. Men may own several wigs for different purposes. This tradition continues today; "Wigmen" perform at cultural events and singsings (gatherings), representing Huli identity to domestic and international audiences. The wigs have become symbols of Papua New Guinea's cultural heritage.</p>

            <h2>Compensation and Conflict</h2>
            <p>Traditional Huli society featured endemic warfare between clans but was regulated by elaborate compensation payments. When wrongs occurred—killing, injury, adultery, land disputes—disputes were resolved through negotiations culminating in compensation payments, typically in pigs and shells. The amount depended on the offense severity and the parties' relationships. This system prevented endless revenge cycles while acknowledging wrongs. Warfare was highly ritualized; battles were announced, casualties were typically limited, and peace could be negotiated. Colonial pacification ended large-scale warfare, but compensation practices continue, adapted to include cash. Violence still occurs, particularly over land and in connection with resource extraction; modern conflicts often lack traditional constraints.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Huli</h2>
            <p>Modern Huli have been dramatically affected by resource extraction. The massive PNG LNG natural gas project operates in Huli territory, bringing royalties, employment, and infrastructure but also social disruption, land disputes, and environmental concerns. Distribution of benefits has been contentious. Education and Christianity (primarily evangelical) have spread widely; traditional practices coexist with new influences. Urban migration has increased. Hela Province, created in 2012, gave Huli greater political autonomy. The Huli language remains strong. Traditional dress is maintained for ceremonies; "sing-sings" showcase cultural heritage. However, concerns exist about cultural continuity as young people engage more with global culture. The Huli demonstrate both the resilience of highland PNG cultures and the challenges of managing resource extraction while maintaining cultural identity.</p>
