            <h2>Who Are the Hausa People?</h2>
            <p>The Hausa are one of Africa's largest ethnic groups, with approximately 80-100 million people primarily in northern Nigeria and southern Niger, with significant diaspora communities across West Africa and beyond. They speak Hausa, a Chadic language serving as West Africa's most widespread lingua franca—second-language speakers may equal native speakers. The Hausa developed sophisticated city-states from medieval times, dominated trans-Saharan trade, and became predominantly Muslim by the 15th century. Their commercial networks, educational traditions, and cultural influence extend far beyond their homeland.</p>

            <h2>The Hausa City-States</h2>
            <p>Before the 19th century Fulani jihad, the Hausa organized into independent city-states (birni)—Kano, Katsina, Zaria, Gobir, and others—each ruled by a sarki (king). These walled cities served as commercial centers, craft production hubs, and Islamic learning sites. Kano, in particular, became one of sub-Saharan Africa's greatest cities, with markets drawing traders from across the Sahara. The city-states competed and warred but shared Hausa language and increasingly, Islam. When the Fulani jihad conquered these states, merging them into the Sokoto Caliphate, Hausa urban culture continued, now under Fulani aristocracy.</p>

            <h2>Trade and Commerce</h2>
            <p>The Hausa established West Africa's most extensive trading networks. Hausa merchants dominated trans-Saharan trade routes carrying gold, salt, slaves, leather goods, and textiles. Their commercial diaspora spread across the region—Hausa trader communities exist throughout West and Central Africa. Commercial success required literacy (in Arabic and Ajami—Hausa written in Arabic script), mathematical skills, and credit systems. This trading heritage continues: Hausa remain prominent in contemporary Nigerian commerce. The association of Hausa identity with trade is so strong that non-Hausa traders sometimes adopt Hausa identity.</p>

            <h2>Islamic Scholarship</h2>
            <p>Hausaland became a major center of Islamic learning. The tradition of almajiri education—boys studying Quran with itinerant scholars—spread widely. Cities like Kano and Katsina hosted advanced Islamic scholars whose works circulated across West Africa. The Sokoto Caliphate's founders were Hausa-educated scholars (though ethnically Fulani). Islamic law shaped governance and society. Today, tensions exist between traditional Islamic education and modern secular schooling. The almajiri system faces criticism for producing vulnerable street children, but Islamic education remains culturally significant for Hausa identity.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Nigeria</h2>
            <p>In Nigeria, Hausa-Fulani (the two groups have heavily intermixed) dominate the north politically and demographically. Nigeria's politics often divide along north-south, Muslim-Christian lines, with Hausa-Fulani representing the northern Muslim bloc. Implementation of sharia law in northern states beginning in 2000 reflected Hausa-Fulani political power and cultural preferences. Inter-ethnic competition, religious tensions, and economic disparities shape Hausa political engagement. Despite challenges, Hausa culture remains vibrant—Hausa-language media, literature, and Nollywood films reach millions across West Africa.</p>
