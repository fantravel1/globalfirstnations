            <h2>Who Are the Juang?</h2>
            <p>The Juang (also Juanga or Patua) are an indigenous tribal people of the Keonjhar and Dhenkanal districts in Odisha state, eastern India. Numbering approximately 45,000-50,000, they inhabit the forested hills of the northern Eastern Ghats. The Juang speak Juang, an isolated Munda language of the Austroasiatic family, representing one of India's oldest linguistic lineages. Historically known as "Pattua" (leaf-wearers) because traditional dress consisted of leaves, the Juang have experienced significant cultural change while remaining among India's most economically marginalized tribal groups. They are classified as a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG), receiving special government attention for their vulnerable status.</p>

            <h2>Forest Dwellers</h2>
            <p>Traditional Juang life centered on the forests of the Eastern Ghats. Shifting cultivation (podu) provided the agricultural base, with families clearing forest patches to grow millets, pulses, and vegetables. Hunting and gathering supplemented cultivation; forests supplied game, wild fruits, roots, honey, and materials for houses and tools. The Juang developed intimate knowledge of forest ecology, seasonal cycles, and plant uses. Collection and sale of minor forest products—particularly kendu leaves for bidi (cigarette) production—became an important cash source. Traditional leaf clothing has largely given way to cloth, but the forest connection remains central to Juang identity and subsistence, even as deforestation threatens their resource base.</p>

            <h2>Majang System</h2>
            <p>Traditional Juang society featured the majang (youth dormitory), an institution common among many Indian tribal societies. Young people lived together in dormitories separate from family homes, learning cultural knowledge, work skills, and social behavior. The dormitory system facilitated socialization, courtship, and transmission of tradition. Boys and girls had separate dormitories (mandaghar and majang) but interacted in structured ways. The dormitory system has declined as formal schooling has expanded and settlement patterns have changed. Some communities maintain modified versions; others have abandoned the institution entirely. The decline of dormitories represents broader cultural change as Juang society adapts to new circumstances.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Juang</h2>
            <p>Modern Juang face severe challenges of poverty, malnutrition, and marginalization. Health indicators are poor; infant mortality is high; malnutrition affects many children. Educational attainment lags behind state averages despite government programs. Mining activities in mineral-rich Keonjhar district threaten some Juang territories while providing limited employment opportunities. Displacement from traditional lands and deforestation have undermined traditional livelihoods. Government programs provide food, housing, and other support, but impact is uneven. Some Juang have accessed education and employment; others remain in severe poverty. The Juang case illustrates the challenges faced by India's most vulnerable tribal populations in accessing development benefits while maintaining cultural identity.</p>
