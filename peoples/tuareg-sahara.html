            <h2>Who Are the Tuareg?</h2>
            <p>The Tuareg are a Berber (Amazigh) people of approximately 2-3 million inhabiting the Sahara Desert across Mali, Niger, Algeria, Libya, and Burkina Faso. Known as the "Blue People" for indigo-dyed clothing that stains the skin, Tuareg traditionally dominated trans-Saharan trade routes. Their society features unusual gender dynamics—men veil while women don't, and lineage traces through mothers. Tuareg maintain their own script (Tifinagh) and have fought for autonomy in Mali and Niger since independence. The 2012 Tuareg rebellion briefly established an independent Azawad before Islamist takeover and French intervention.</p>

            <h2>The Tagelmust</h2>
            <p>The tagelmust is the distinctive indigo veil worn by Tuareg men—up to 15 feet of cloth wound around the head and face, leaving only eyes visible. Unlike most Muslim cultures where women veil, Tuareg men cover their faces while women remain unveiled. The veil provides practical desert protection but carries deep cultural meaning: it's shameful for adult men to show their mouths to elders or in-laws. The indigo dye rubs off on skin, earning Tuareg their "Blue People" nickname. This gender reversal of veiling practices distinguishes Tuareg from neighboring Arab populations.</p>

            <h2>Matrilineal Elements</h2>
            <p>Tuareg society features significant matrilineal elements unusual in the broader Muslim world. Property and status historically passed through women; maternal uncles held more importance than fathers for many matters. Women owned tents and livestock; divorce was easy for women. Women also traditionally served as musicians and poets, transmitting culture. While patrilineal Islamic law has influenced Tuareg practice, matrilineal traces persist. Women maintain high social status and freedom compared to other Saharan societies. This gender system represents pre-Islamic Berber practices maintained despite centuries of Islam.</p>

            <h2>Rebellion and Azawad</h2>
            <p>Tuareg have fought for autonomy since Mali and Niger gained independence. Rebellions erupted in the 1960s, 1990s, 2007, and 2012. The 2012 rebellion, aided by weapons from Libya's collapse, initially succeeded—the MNLA declared an independent Azawad. However, Islamist groups (including al-Qaeda affiliates) seized control, prompting French military intervention. The dream of Azawad remains unfulfilled; Tuareg areas suffer ongoing conflict, Islamist presence, and government neglect. The Tuareg situation illustrates how colonial boundaries divided nomadic peoples across states that fail to accommodate their needs.</p>

            <h2>Desert Blues Music</h2>
            <p>Tuareg music, particularly "desert blues" or "Saharan rock," has achieved international recognition. Artists like Tinariwen, Bombino, and Mdou Moctar blend traditional Tuareg music with electric guitars and rock influences. Lyrics address nomadic life, love, and political struggles. International tours and recordings have brought Tuareg culture to global audiences. Music provides both cultural expression and income in contexts where traditional nomadism is increasingly difficult. The genre represents creative adaptation—maintaining Tuareg identity while engaging global musical forms, just as Tuareg historically adapted to changing trade routes and political circumstances.</p>
