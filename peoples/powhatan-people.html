            <h2>Who Are the Powhatan?</h2>
            <p>The Powhatan were an Algonquian-speaking confederacy of approximately 30 tribes inhabiting the Tidewater region of Virginia when English colonizers arrived in 1607. Named after the paramount chief Wahunsenacawh (known to the English as Powhatan), the confederacy numbered perhaps 14,000-21,000 people. They spoke Virginia Algonquian, now extinct. The Powhatan were the first indigenous people to have extensive contact with English colonizers in what became the United States, and their interactions with the Jamestown colony—including the famous story of Pocahontas—shaped the early trajectory of English colonization. Today, state-recognized tribes descended from the Powhatan include the Pamunkey (now federally recognized) and several others in Virginia.</p>

            <h2>Powhatan Confederacy</h2>
            <p>By 1607, Wahunsenacawh had consolidated approximately 30 tribes into a paramount chiefdom through conquest and alliance, creating one of the largest political units along the Atlantic coast. The confederacy featured hierarchical leadership—the paramount chief received tribute, appointed local weroances (chiefs), and commanded warriors. Villages lined the rivers of the Tidewater, with bark-covered longhouses housing multiple families. Agriculture was central—women cultivated corn, beans, squash, and tobacco—supplemented by hunting, fishing, and gathering. Men hunted deer and other game, fished the abundant waterways, and served as warriors. This complex society impressed English observers, though they often failed to understand its political sophistication.</p>

            <h2>Jamestown and Conflict</h2>
            <p>The 1607 establishment of Jamestown placed English colonizers within Powhatan territory. Initial relations mixed trade and tension; Wahunsenacawh may have initially viewed the English as potential allies against western enemies. The story of Pocahontas—her possible rescue of John Smith, her marriage to John Rolfe, her trip to England, and her early death—became mythologized into a tale of Indian-colonial friendship that obscured the reality of dispossession. Anglo-Powhatan Wars (1610-1614, 1622-1632, 1644-1646) resulted in Powhatan defeat and massive land loss. Wahunsenacawh died in 1618; his brother Opechancanough led later resistance. By 1646, the confederacy was broken, survivors confined to reservations, and Virginia's indigenous population devastated.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Powhatan</h2>
            <p>Descendants of the Powhatan Confederacy maintained communities in Virginia despite centuries of marginalization. Under Virginia's racial laws (the "Racial Integrity Act" of 1924), Native peoples were often classified as "colored," denying their indigenous identity. The Pamunkey and Mattaponi retained small reservations, the oldest in the United States. Other communities persisted without reservations. Beginning in the 1980s, Virginia state recognition came to several tribes. The Pamunkey achieved federal recognition in 2016—a landmark after decades of effort. Today, Virginia recognizes eleven tribes descended from the Powhatan, working to maintain cultural identity, secure federal recognition, and educate the public about Powhatan history beyond the Pocahontas mythology.</p>
