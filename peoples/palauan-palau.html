            <h2>Who Are the Palauans?</h2>
            <p>The Palauans (Belauans) are the indigenous Micronesian people of the Republic of Palau, numbering approximately 18,000 in Palau and 10,000+ abroad. They speak Palauan, a Western Malayo-Polynesian language, and maintain one of Micronesia's most intact traditional cultures. Palau's 340 islands feature the famous Rock Islands—UNESCO World Heritage limestone formations—and some of the world's most pristine marine environments. Palauan society is matrilineal, with elaborate money systems, communal houses (bai), and sophisticated marine management. Independent since 1994 in free association with the US, Palau has become a leader in marine conservation.</p>

            </div>

            <h2>Matrilineal Society</h2>
            <p>Palauan society is strongly matrilineal—clan membership, land rights, and traditional titles pass through mothers. Women's councils (mechesil belau) wield significant political power, selecting male chiefs and making major decisions. The highest female title, the Bilung, parallels male high chiefs. Traditional money (udoud) includes ceramic beads and glass pieces, valued by age and history; this "money" circulates primarily in ceremonial exchanges controlled by women. Clan women own land; men work it but cannot sell it. This female authority structure has persisted despite colonial attempts to impose patriarchal systems.</p>

            <h2>The Bai</h2>
            <p>The bai (men's meeting house) represents Palauan architectural achievement—large wooden structures decorated with elaborate painted and carved storyboards depicting legends, history, and moral teachings. Each village traditionally had a bai where men gathered for meetings, ceremonies, and visitors. The storyboards encoded cultural knowledge; different bai told different stories. Japanese and American colonialism damaged many bai, but restoration efforts continue. The Belau National Museum preserves traditional bai, and contemporary artists maintain storyboard traditions. The bai symbolizes Palauan identity, community gathering, and cultural knowledge transmission.</p>

            <h2>Marine Conservation</h2>
            <p>Palau has emerged as a global leader in marine conservation, combining traditional practices with modern protection. The bul system—traditional moratoriums on harvesting specific marine areas—provided indigenous sustainability. In 2015, Palau created the Palau National Marine Sanctuary, protecting 80% of its ocean territory from fishing—one of the world's largest marine reserves. Visitors pay a $100 "Pristine Paradise Environmental Fee" and sign an environmental pledge. While tourism provides income, Palau limits visitors to reduce impact. This model of indigenous-informed conservation has attracted global attention.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Palau</h2>
            <p>Independent since 1994 under a Compact of Free Association with the US, Palau receives American aid in exchange for military access; Palauans can live and work in the US. Tourism (especially diving) dominates the economy; Palau attracts visitors to its jellyfish lakes, pristine reefs, and WWII wrecks. Climate change threatens low-lying areas, though most islands are high limestone. Traditional culture remains strong—first-birth ceremonies, funerals, and matrilineal structures continue. How Palau balances tourism, conservation, traditional culture, and economic development while maintaining sovereignty under US association shapes its unique Pacific path.</p>
