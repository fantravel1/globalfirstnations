            <h2>Who Are the Wayuu?</h2>
            <p>The Wayuu (Guajiro) are the largest indigenous group in Colombia and a significant minority in Venezuela, numbering approximately 600,000-800,000. They inhabit the Guajira Peninsula, a semi-arid region extending into the Caribbean Sea between the two countries. They speak Wayuunaiki, an Arawakan language. The Wayuu maintained substantial independence throughout the colonial period, using their desert homeland's harsh conditions as protection and becoming skilled pastoralists after acquiring cattle and goats from Spanish. Today they are known for their matrilineal clan system, elaborate funeral rituals, and the internationally famous hand-woven bags called mochilas or susu. Despite their large population, the Wayuu face serious challenges including water scarcity and child malnutrition.</p>

            <h2>Matrilineal Society</h2>
            <p>Wayuu society is organized into matrilineal clans (eiruku). Children belong to their mother's clan, inheriting rights and obligations through the maternal line. Each clan has an animal totem—common ones include turtle, jaguar, and deer. Clan membership determines marriage possibilities, residence patterns, and collective responsibilities including blood feuds. The palabrero system provides traditional conflict resolution: designated mediators (palabreros) negotiate between clans to resolve disputes, particularly blood feuds, through compensation payments. UNESCO recognized the Wayuu normative system, including the palabrero role, as Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2010. Women hold significant social power, controlling livestock inheritance and household resources, though leadership positions are held by maternal uncles rather than women themselves.</p>

            <h2>Weaving Tradition</h2>
            <p>Wayuu weaving is culturally central and economically important. Women learn to weave from childhood, with skill level indicating social status. The mochila (woven bag) is the iconic Wayuu craft—each piece takes 2-3 weeks to complete and features geometric patterns (kanasü) that represent natural elements and clan symbols. Traditionally, weaving knowledge came from Wale'kerü, a spider spirit who taught the first Wayuu woman. Hammocks, belts, and sandals are also woven. The international popularity of mochilas has created economic opportunities but also problems with appropriation and mass production of "Wayuu-style" bags by non-Wayuu. Authenticity certification programs attempt to protect Wayuu weavers. Weaving remains a living tradition, connecting contemporary Wayuu women to ancestral knowledge and providing sustainable income.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Wayuu</h2>
            <p>Modern Wayuu face severe humanitarian challenges. The Guajira region suffers extreme drought exacerbated by climate change, and Colombia's deadliest river, the Ranchería, has been diverted for coal mining (Cerrejón mine). Child malnutrition deaths have prompted international attention and legal cases against the Colombian government. Many Wayuu have migrated to cities including Maracaibo and Riohacha. The Venezuela crisis has affected Wayuu on both sides of the border. Despite these challenges, Wayuu culture remains vital—the language is widely spoken, traditional medicine and spirituality persist, and social organization through clans continues. Wayuu politicians and activists advocate for water rights and territorial protection. The Wayuu represent both the resilience of indigenous culture and the environmental justice issues facing indigenous communities globally.</p>
