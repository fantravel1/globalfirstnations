            <h2>Who Are the Sotho?</h2>
            <p>The Sotho (Basotho) are a Bantu-speaking people of approximately 7 million, divided between South Africa (5.5 million, where they're called Southern Sotho or Sesotho-speakers) and Lesotho (2 million). They speak Sesotho, one of South Africa's official languages. The Sotho were united by King Moshoeshoe I in the early 19th century, forming a nation that survived the Mfecane upheavals and Boer aggression by seeking British protection. This diplomatic strategy created Basutoland, which became independent Lesotho in 1966—a country completely surrounded by South Africa, known as the "Kingdom in the Sky" for its mountainous terrain.</p>

            <h2>Moshoeshoe the Great</h2>
            <p>Moshoeshoe I (c. 1786-1870) is one of Africa's greatest nation-builders. During the Mfecane—the period of warfare and displacement caused by Zulu expansion—Moshoeshoe gathered refugees from various groups at his mountain fortress Thaba Bosiu, forging them into the Sotho nation through diplomacy rather than conquest. He welcomed missionaries for their literacy and diplomatic connections, used cattle loans (mafisa) to create obligations, and played Boers, British, and other African powers against each other to preserve his kingdom. When military options failed, he secured British protectorate status that prevented Boer annexation. His legacy shapes both Lesotho and South African Sotho identity.</p>

            <h2>The Basotho Blanket</h2>
            <p>The Basotho blanket is the most recognizable Sotho cultural symbol—a thick woolen blanket worn as everyday clothing, particularly in Lesotho's cold mountains. Introduced by European traders in the 19th century, the blanket was adopted and transformed into a cultural marker. Specific patterns carry meanings; blankets are gifted at important occasions; wearing style indicates status and occasion. The Seanamarena design featuring corn cobs is particularly prestigious. Though originally imported, the blanket has become authentically Basotho—an example of how cultures adopt and transform foreign items into distinctive cultural property.</p>

            <h2>Lesotho's Challenges</h2>
            <p>Lesotho, completely surrounded by South Africa, faces unique vulnerabilities. Its economy depends heavily on migrant labor to South African mines, water exports to South Africa, and textile manufacturing. Political instability has marked post-independence history, with multiple coups and interventions. HIV/AIDS has devastated the population—at one point, Lesotho had the world's third-highest prevalence. Poverty remains widespread despite water resources. The country's existence as an independent state—an accident of colonial history that left this Sotho homeland separate from South Africa—creates ongoing questions about economic viability and political sovereignty.</p>

            <h2>Sotho in South Africa</h2>
            <p>South African Sotho, concentrated in the Free State province and Gauteng, comprise one of the country's largest ethnic groups. Under apartheid, they were assigned to the Qwaqwa "homeland"—a poor, fragmented territory. Post-apartheid, Sesotho became an official language; Sotho politicians have held prominent positions. Cultural practices—including initiation schools, traditional medicine, and ancestor veneration—continue alongside Christianity and modern life. The Sotho share with Tswana and Pedi a broader "Sotho-Tswana" cultural cluster, but maintain distinct identity through language, history, and connection to either Lesotho or specifically South African experience.</p>
