            <h2>Who Are the Kayapó?</h2>
            <p>The Kayapó (Mẽbêngôkre, "people from the water's source") are an indigenous nation of approximately 12,000 people inhabiting the Xingu River basin in the Brazilian Amazon. Famous for their elaborate body paint, feather headdresses, and fierce warrior traditions, the Kayapó have become global symbols of indigenous environmental activism. Their successful campaign against the Belo Monte dam and ongoing battles against illegal mining and logging have made them among the most prominent indigenous voices in rainforest conservation.</p>

            <h2>Body Art and Identity</h2>
            <p>Kayapó body decoration is among the world's most elaborate. Black body paint from genipap fruit and red from urucum seeds create striking geometric patterns encoding social information—age, gender, ceremonial roles, and clan affiliations. The distinctive disc lip plates worn by men represent oratory skill and leadership; the ability to speak well is central to Kayapó politics. Elaborate feather headdresses display relationships with specific animals and spiritual powers. This visual language communicates Kayapó identity to other Kayapó and distinguishes them from outsiders.</p>

            <h2>Chief Raoni and Global Activism</h2>
            <p>Raoni Metuktire, born around 1930, has led Kayapó resistance for decades. His striking appearance—yellow feather headdress, lip disc, painted face—made him recognizable worldwide during his 1989 tour with musician Sting to oppose Amazon deforestation. Raoni has met presidents, popes, and celebrities, bringing the Kayapó struggle to international attention. His ongoing campaigns against Belo Monte dam, illegal mining, and Brazilian government policies hostile to indigenous rights continue into his 90s. Raoni represents how indigenous leaders can become global environmental advocates.</p>

            <h2>Environmental Stewardship</h2>
            <p>Kayapó territory remains among the best-preserved areas of the Amazon, with satellite imagery showing clear boundaries where protected indigenous land meets deforested surroundings. The Kayapó have developed their own territorial monitoring systems, using GPS and cameras to document invasions. Their fire management techniques prevent catastrophic burns while maintaining forest health. Some communities have developed sustainable Brazil nut harvesting and ecotourism as alternatives to destructive extraction. The Kayapó demonstrate that indigenous territorial control is effective conservation.</p>

            <h2>Challenges and Contradictions</h2>
            <p>Kayapó communities have sometimes faced criticism for allowing logging or mining on their territory, reflecting internal debates about development and the reality that indigenous peoples must navigate impossible choices when surrounded by destruction and poverty. Different villages and leaders take different positions. The transition from relative isolation to global integration within decades creates tensions between traditional practices and contemporary life. Despite these challenges, the Kayapó maintain cultural distinctiveness while adapting to changing circumstances.</p>
