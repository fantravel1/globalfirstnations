            <h2>Who Are the Kuba?</h2>
            <p>The Kuba are a cluster of Bantu ethnic groups in south-central Democratic Republic of Congo, numbering approximately 200,000-250,000. They speak Kuba languages of the Bantu family. The Kuba inhabit the region between the Sankuru and Kasai rivers in the Kasai Province. The Kuba Kingdom, founded in the early 17th century, became one of Central Africa's most sophisticated states, renowned for its elaborate court rituals, complex political organization, and extraordinarily rich artistic traditions. Kuba textiles, sculptures, and decorative arts rank among the world's most admired, featuring intricate geometric patterns that influenced modern European art.</p>

            <h2>The Kuba Kingdom</h2>
            <p>The Kuba Kingdom was founded around 1625 when the Bushong group established dominance over neighboring peoples, creating a federation of some 18 groups under the nyim (king). The kingdom developed elaborate political structures: councils, titled officials, and complex succession rules. Kings were divine figures surrounded by elaborate court ritual. Each nyim was memorialized by a carved ndop statue depicting him in royal regalia. The kingdom maintained independence through the colonial period, with Belgian administrators ruling through the nyim. Though formal political authority diminished after independence, the kingdom's structure persists; a nyim still reigns as cultural leader.</p>

            <h2>Textile Arts</h2>
            <p>Kuba textiles are among Africa's most celebrated artistic achievements. Woven from raffia palm fiber, these textiles feature extraordinarily complex geometric patterns created through cut-pile embroidery. Different techniques produce different effects: plush cut-pile, flat weaving, and appliqué combine in single pieces. Each pattern carries meaning and history; designs are named and associated with specific persons or times. European artists including Henri Matisse collected Kuba textiles, and their influence appears in modern art. Women created the embroidered patterns while men wove the base cloth—a gendered collaboration producing works that remain highly valued in the international art market.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Kuba</h2>
            <p>Modern Kuba maintain their kingdom's cultural structures while navigating DRC's challenges. The nyim (currently Kot a-Mbweeky III) serves as cultural leader, though without formal political power. Traditional arts continue, with textiles, masks, and sculptures produced both for local use and international markets. The Kasai region has faced periodic conflicts and economic difficulties. Diamond mining has brought both wealth and problems. Agriculture—cassava, maize, palm products—provides subsistence. Many Kuba have migrated to Kinshasa and other cities. Christian churches have become important, while traditional rituals persist. How the Kuba maintain their remarkable artistic heritage and kingdom traditions amid modern pressures shapes this culturally significant people's future.</p>
