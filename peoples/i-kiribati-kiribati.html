            <h2>Who Are the I-Kiribati?</h2>
            <p>The I-Kiribati are the indigenous Micronesian people of the Republic of Kiribati (pronounced "Kiribas"), numbering approximately 120,000 across 33 atolls and one raised coral island spanning 3.5 million square kilometers of Pacific Ocean. They speak Gilbertese (Taetae ni Kiribati), an Austronesian language. Kiribati straddles the equator and International Date Line—its easternmost islands see Earth's first sunrise. Traditional culture features communal meeting houses (maneaba), elaborate dancing, and shark worship. As the world's lowest-lying nation (average elevation 2 meters), Kiribati faces complete inundation from climate change.</p>

            <h2>The Maneaba</h2>
            <p>The maneaba (traditional meeting house) stands at the center of I-Kiribati community life. These large thatched structures, built without nails using traditional techniques, serve as venues for community meetings, celebrations, and conflict resolution. Seating within the maneaba is strictly prescribed—each family clan has designated positions reflecting traditional status. The maneaba system (te maneaba) refers not just to the building but to the entire system of community governance, dispute resolution, and social organization conducted within it. Contemporary villages maintain maneaba alongside Christian churches; both institutions shape community life.</p>

            <h2>Dance and Performance</h2>
            <p>I-Kiribati dance (te bino, te kaimatoa) features distinctive movements—precise hand gestures, subtle body positioning, and controlled footwork contrasting with the energetic drumming and chanting accompaniment. Dancers wear elaborate costumes including te riri (grass skirts) and flower crowns. Dance competitions are serious events; villages invest months in preparation. Performance encodes stories, history, and cultural values. The movements—particularly the seated women's dances with their intricate hand choreography—have been compared to Asian dance traditions, suggesting ancient cultural connections. Dance remains central to I-Kiribati identity and celebration.</p>

            <h2>Climate Refugees</h2>
            <p>Kiribati represents ground zero for climate change impacts. With an average elevation of 2 meters, rising seas have already contaminated freshwater supplies, eroded coastlines, and flooded villages during king tides. Scientific projections suggest the nation could be largely uninhabitable by 2100. Former President Anote Tong pursued "migration with dignity," purchasing land in Fiji and advocating for climate refugee recognition. The current government focuses on adaptation—raising islands, building seawalls. The I-Kiribati face potential loss of homeland, nationality, and culture. Their plight raises unprecedented questions about climate justice and national identity.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Kiribati</h2>
            <p>Independent since 1979, Kiribati has limited economic options—copra, fishing license fees, and overseas worker remittances provide most income. The Phoenix Islands Protected Area, one of the world's largest marine reserves, was created in 2008. Many I-Kiribati work abroad as seafarers or in New Zealand's seasonal worker program. Traditional culture remains strong, though climate change forces difficult choices about staying or migrating. The question of what happens to I-Kiribati identity if the nation disappears beneath the waves—and how the international community should respond—defines their uncertain future.</p>
