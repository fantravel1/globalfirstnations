            <h2>Who Are the Murut?</h2>
            <p>The Murut are an indigenous people of northern Borneo, primarily inhabiting the interior highlands of Sabah (Malaysia), Sarawak, Brunei, and Kalimantan (Indonesia). Numbering approximately 100,000, they were historically among the island's most formidable headhunters and the last group in Borneo to abandon the practice. Today, they are perhaps best known for their unique trampoline tradition—the lansaran.</p>
            <p>The name "Murut" means "hill people" in coastal languages. They comprise numerous subgroups including the Tagal, Nabai, Timugon, and others, speaking related but distinct Austronesian languages. Their traditional territory encompasses rugged mountain terrain that historically isolated them from coastal influences and colonial control.</p>

            <h2>The Headhunting Past</h2>
            <p>Until the early 20th century, headhunting was central to Murut warfare and spirituality. Taking heads demonstrated warrior prowess, protected communities from enemy spirits, and was necessary for certain rituals including marriage. Skulls were preserved in longhouses and honored with offerings.</p>
            <p>The practice served complex social functions beyond warfare: it resolved disputes, marked transitions to adulthood, and connected the living with spiritual powers. British colonial authorities and Christian missionaries worked to suppress headhunting, which largely ended by the 1930s—though isolated incidents occurred during World War II resistance against Japanese occupation.</p>

            <h2>The Lansaran Trampoline</h2>
            <p>The Murut's most distinctive tradition is the lansaran—a large trampoline made from flexible bark or bamboo strips, traditionally used in celebrations. Participants bounce while trying to grab prizes hung overhead, competing for height and skill. The activity appears in harvest festivals, weddings, and other celebrations.</p>
            <p>Beyond entertainment, the lansaran has ritualistic significance connected to agricultural cycles and community bonding. Similar trampolines exist among related peoples, but the Murut version is most developed. Today, lansaran competitions draw tourists and help preserve cultural identity, transforming a traditional practice into a symbol of Murut heritage.</p>

            <h2>Longhouse Life</h2>
            <p>Traditional Murut communities lived in massive longhouses—single structures housing entire villages, sometimes exceeding 100 meters in length. Each family occupied a room opening onto a common gallery used for socializing, ceremonies, and drying harvests. The longhouse represented both practical adaptation to the environment and expression of communal values.</p>
            <p>Longhouse society emphasized reciprocity, consensus decision-making, and collective responsibility. The headman (orang tua) led through persuasion rather than command. Rice wine (tapai), brewed from rice or tapioca, was essential for hospitality and ceremonies—guests were expected to drink from communal jars through long straws.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Life</h2>
            <p>Today, most Murut have adopted Christianity (both Protestant and Catholic) and live in individual family houses rather than longhouses. Many have shifted from swidden agriculture to cash crops, wage labor, or government employment. Traditional practices survive primarily in cultural festivals and rural communities.</p>
            <p>The Murut Cultural Centre in Sabah works to preserve and promote traditional arts, crafts, music, and dance. Annual festivals celebrate Murut heritage with lansaran competitions, traditional music, and craft demonstrations. Younger generations navigate between traditional identity and modern Malaysian society.</p>
