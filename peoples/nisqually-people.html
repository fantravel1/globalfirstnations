            <h2>Who Are the Nisqually?</h2>
            <p>The Nisqually Indian Tribe has approximately 830 enrolled members, headquartered on their reservation near Olympia, Washington. Their name means "People of the Grass Lands," referring to the prairies at the mouth of the Nisqually River. They speak Lushootseed, a Central Salish language shared with many Puget Sound tribes, now with very few fluent speakers. The Nisqually were signatories to the 1854 Medicine Creek Treaty, the first treaty in Washington Territory. Their fight for treaty fishing rights, led by Billy Frank Jr., fundamentally changed Indian law in America.</p>

            <h2>Billy Frank Jr. and the Fish Wars</h2>
            <p>Billy Frank Jr. (1931-2014) became the face of treaty fishing rights after decades of arrests for fishing on the Nisqually River. The "Fish Wars" of the 1960s-70s saw tribal fishers arrested, beaten, and jailed for exercising treaty rights. The 1974 Boldt Decision (U.S. v. Washington) affirmed that treaties reserved 50% of the salmon harvest for tribes. Frank later led the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission, working on salmon recovery and environmental protection. He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2015. The Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge was renamed in his honor.</p>

            <h2>The Nisqually River Delta</h2>
            <p>The Nisqually River delta, where the river meets Puget Sound, was central to traditional Nisqually life. Rich in salmon, shellfish, and waterfowl, the delta supported villages for millennia. The Billy Frank Jr. Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge now protects much of this ecosystem. The tribe has worked on one of the largest estuary restoration projects in the Pacific Northwest—removing dikes to restore tidal wetlands. This restoration benefits salmon, wildlife, and Nisqually cultural connection to the land. The delta represents both historical importance and contemporary environmental leadership.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Nisqually</h2>
            <p>Modern Nisqually have built on their fishing rights victory to become environmental leaders. The tribe co-manages Nisqually River salmon with state agencies. Shellfish harvesting, particularly geoduck, provides economic benefits. The Red Wind Casino supports tribal programs. Language preservation works to save Lushootseed; the tribe participates in regional language programs with other Puget Sound tribes. Environmental programs address habitat restoration and climate adaptation. Billy Frank Jr.'s legacy shapes tribal identity and priorities. How the Nisqually continue environmental leadership while building economic capacity honors this fishing rights pioneer's work.</p>
