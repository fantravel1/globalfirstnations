            <h2>Who Are the Cowichan?</h2>
            <p>The Cowichan (Quw'utsun) are a Coast Salish First Nation of the Cowichan Valley and adjacent areas of southeastern Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. Numbering approximately 4,900-5,000, they are one of the largest First Nations bands in Canada. They speak Hul'q'umi'num' (Island Halkomelem), a Salishan language shared with neighboring groups. The name Cowichan means "warm land" or "warm back" (referring to the mountains protecting the valley), reflecting the relatively mild climate. The Cowichan are internationally famous for their distinctive sweaters—hand-knitted woolen garments featuring bold geometric designs that have become an iconic Canadian craft.</p>

            <h2>Cowichan Sweaters</h2>
            <p>The Cowichan sweater is one of North America's most recognized Indigenous crafts. These heavy, water-resistant sweaters feature bold geometric designs—often incorporating stylized animals, nature motifs, and abstract patterns—knitted from natural, unprocessed wool that retains lanolin for water resistance. The tradition developed in the late 19th century when European settlers introduced sheep and knitting; Cowichan women adapted the craft to their aesthetic, creating a distinctive style. Each sweater is hand-knitted, typically taking 40-60 hours to complete. The sweaters became fashionable beyond the region; celebrities and politicians have worn them. Counterfeit sweaters (machine-made or produced elsewhere) threaten authenticity; the Cowichan have sought trademark protection. The sweaters represent successful cultural adaptation—incorporating European technology into Indigenous expression.</p>

            <h2>Coast Salish Society</h2>
            <p>The Cowichan were among the most populous groups on Vancouver Island pre-contact, their large population supported by salmon runs, seafood, and forest resources. Coast Salish society featured a complex class system: high-ranking families held hereditary rights to resources, names, and ceremonies; commoners provided labor; slaves (typically war captives) held lowest status. Winter villages were substantial, with large cedar plank houses. Summer saw dispersal to fishing and gathering sites. The longhouse served as dwelling, ceremony space, and social institution. Colonial policies disrupted this society; disease reduced population; the Indian Act banned potlatches. Despite suppression, Cowichan maintained many traditions, adapting to changed circumstances.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Cowichan</h2>
            <p>Modern Cowichan live primarily in the Cowichan Valley region around Duncan, one of British Columbia's more urbanized Indigenous areas. The Cowichan Tribes government provides extensive services. Economic activities include logging, fishing, and the famous sweater industry; tourism and cultural enterprises have grown. The Quw'utsun Cultural Centre showcases heritage. Language revitalization addresses decline; Hul'q'umi'num' programs serve community members. Treaty negotiations continue. Environmental advocacy, particularly regarding salmon habitat, engages Cowichan activists. Relations with the surrounding community are complex; Duncan has a significant Indigenous population but also histories of discrimination. The Cowichan demonstrate how large, urbanized First Nations maintain cultural identity—including globally recognized crafts—while navigating the challenges of integration and assertion of rights.</p>
