            <h2>Who Are the Monacan?</h2>
            <p>The Monacan are a Siouan-speaking Native American tribe originally inhabiting the piedmont and Blue Ridge Mountain regions of Virginia, distinct from the Algonquian-speaking Powhatan peoples of the coastal plain. Today numbering approximately 2,000 enrolled members, the Monacan Indian Nation is centered at Bear Mountain in Amherst County, Virginia. Unlike Virginia's Algonquian tribes, the Monacan spoke a Siouan language (now extinct) related to tribes of the Carolinas and Midwest. This linguistic difference reflects their distinct cultural identity and historical trajectory. The Monacan achieved federal recognition in 2018 alongside other Virginia tribes, finally securing official acknowledgment of their continuous existence despite centuries of marginalization.</p>

            <h2>Piedmont Confederacy</h2>
            <p>The Monacan led a confederacy of Siouan-speaking tribes in Virginia's piedmont region, rivals and sometimes enemies of the coastal Powhatan. When Jamestown colonists arrived in 1607, Powhatan encouraged English exploration westward partly hoping they would conflict with the Monacan. Captain John Smith's 1608 journey encountered Monacan people at their capital Rassawek, near present-day Richmond. The Monacan mined copper in the Blue Ridge and traded it widely; copper ornaments were prestige items throughout the region. Unlike the Powhatan who engaged extensively with colonists, the Monacan had less sustained contact, retreating westward as English settlement expanded. By 1700, the Monacan had largely disappeared from colonial records, but they did not disappear—they persisted in the mountain communities of central Virginia.</p>

            <h2>Bear Mountain</h2>
            <p>The modern Monacan community centers on Bear Mountain in Amherst County, where they have lived since at least the early 1800s—possibly much longer. This isolated mountain community maintained indigenous identity while becoming increasingly invisible to the broader society. The Monacan faced Virginia's racial oppression: the 1924 Racial Integrity Act classified them as "colored," denying indigenous identity. Schools were segregated; the Monacan were excluded from white schools but refused to attend Black schools, losing educational access entirely. The Episcopal Church established the Bear Mountain Mission (1908) and eventually a school, providing the only formal education available to Monacan children until desegregation. This mission school created a generation of educated Monacan who would later lead recognition efforts.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Monacan</h2>
            <p>Modern Monacan achieved state recognition in 1989 and federal recognition in 2018 after the Thomasina E. Jordan Indian Tribes of Virginia Federal Recognition Act passed Congress. This recognition brought official acknowledgment, government-to-government relationship, and program access. The tribe operates the Monacan Ancestral Museum at Bear Mountain, interpreting history and culture. The annual Monacan Powwow (May) brings the community together. Economic development includes a tribal administrative complex. Unlike Virginia's Algonquian tribes, the Monacan never had a treaty or reservation—their land at Bear Mountain was purchased by community members over generations. Language revitalization is impossible since the Monacan language was lost before documentation. The Monacan represent Virginia's Siouan heritage, distinct from the better-known Powhatan/Algonquian peoples, demonstrating that Virginia's indigenous diversity extended beyond the coastal confederacies.</p>
