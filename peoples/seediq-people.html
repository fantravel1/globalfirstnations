            <h2>Who Are the Seediq?</h2>
            <p>The Seediq (賽德克族) are an indigenous people of central Taiwan's mountains, numbering approximately 10,000-11,000 people. They speak Seediq, a Formosan language closely related to Atayal. The Seediq were officially recognized as a distinct indigenous group separate from the Atayal in 2008, reflecting linguistic and cultural differences. They inhabit Nantou and Hualien counties in the central mountain range. The Seediq are internationally known for the Wushe Incident (1930), one of the largest and most dramatic anti-colonial uprisings in Japanese-era Taiwan, which became the subject of the epic 2011 film "Warriors of the Rainbow: Seediq Bale."</p>

            <h2>The Wushe Incident</h2>
            <p>The Wushe Incident (霧社事件) of October 27, 1930 stands as one of colonialism's most dramatic resistance episodes. Led by Chief Mona Rudao, Seediq warriors attacked Japanese settlers and officials during a sports day gathering, killing over 130 Japanese. Japan responded with overwhelming military force, including controversial use of poison gas. Hundreds of Seediq died in combat, mass suicide, or subsequent "pacification." The uprising was motivated by accumulated grievances: forced labor, loss of hunting grounds, and cultural suppression. Mona Rudao became a symbol of indigenous resistance. The incident influenced Japanese colonial policy and remains central to Seediq identity and Taiwanese history.</p>

            <h2>Gaya and Rainbow Bridge</h2>
            <p>Seediq culture centers on gaya—ancestral law governing proper conduct, including headhunting requirements. Gaya prescribed rituals, social relations, and ethical behavior. Central to Seediq belief is the Rainbow Bridge (Hakaw Utux), which souls must cross after death to reach the ancestral realm. Only those who properly observed gaya—including successful headhunting for men and mastery of weaving for women—could cross the bridge; others would be rejected. Facial tattoos marked these achievements. The Wushe warriors believed they were fulfilling gaya by defending their people, ensuring their passage across the Rainbow Bridge. This concept gave the uprising spiritual as well as political meaning.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Seediq</h2>
            <p>Modern Seediq gained official recognition as a distinct indigenous group in 2008, after years of advocacy. The 2011 film "Warriors of the Rainbow: Seediq Bale," Taiwan's most expensive film production, brought Seediq history to international audiences. Mona Rudao's legacy is commemorated in monuments and memorials. Seediq communities maintain cultural practices, though language faces decline. Weaving traditions, rituals, and knowledge of gaya continue. Ethnic tourism, particularly related to Wushe Incident sites, provides some economic opportunities. How the Seediq preserve their warrior heritage and cultural distinctiveness—now with official recognition—while addressing contemporary challenges shapes their future as Taiwan's newest-recognized indigenous people.</p>
