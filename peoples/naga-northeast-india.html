            <h2>Who Are the Naga?</h2>
            <p>The Naga are a collection of approximately 60 Tibeto-Burman ethnic groups inhabiting the mountainous borderlands between India and Myanmar. Numbering over three million, they occupy India's Nagaland state plus portions of Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, and Myanmar's Sagaing Region. Despite linguistic and cultural diversity—many Naga tribes cannot understand each other's languages—they share common cultural features including clan-based organization, agricultural practices, and a warrior tradition that once included headhunting as its ultimate expression.</p>

            <h2>The Headhunting Tradition</h2>
            <p>Headhunting was the defining practice of traditional Naga society, serving religious, social, and military functions. Naga believed that vital essence resided in the head, and capturing enemy heads transferred that power to the victor and his village. Heads were displayed on skull trees or in morungs (bachelors' dormitories), where they brought fertility to crops, women, and cattle. A man who had not taken a head was considered incomplete, unable to wear certain prestigious decorations or assume leadership.</p>
            <p>Headhunting raids created cycles of vengeance between villages, with elaborate rituals governing warfare, truce-making, and peace. Warriors who excelled in headhunting gained tattoos, special clothing rights, and positions of honor. The practice persisted until British colonial suppression in the late 19th century and accelerated decline following mass Christian conversion in the 20th century. Today, headhunting exists only in memory, festivals, and the stories of elders.</p>

            <h2>Village Republic Democracy</h2>
            <p>Traditional Naga political organization centered on autonomous village-states. Each village governed itself through assemblies of clan heads and elders, making decisions by consensus. Villages could contain thousands of people and maintained independence through defensive fortifications, warrior strength, and strategic alliances. This "village republic" system created remarkably democratic societies where commoners could achieve prominence through ability.</p>
            <p>The morung served as the institution socializing young men into community life. Boys left their families to live in these dormitories, learning warfare, crafts, songs, and traditions from elder boys and men. Different age-grades assumed different responsibilities, creating structured paths to adulthood. The morung declined with Christianity and modern education but remains culturally significant.</p>

            <h2>Material Culture and Art</h2>
            <p>Naga material culture developed extraordinary sophistication. Textile weaving produced distinctive shawls with geometric patterns specific to each tribe—red and black for Ao, blue for Angami, elaborate embroidery for Chang. These patterns encoded social information about the wearer's tribe, village, achievements, and status. Brass ornaments, boar tusks, hornbill feathers, and cowrie shells adorned warriors, with each element carrying meaning.</p>
            <p>Woodcarving reached high artistry in morungs decorated with carved figures representing fertility symbols, warfare, and mythological scenes. House posts were carved, and wealthy families commissioned elaborate memorial posts. Musical traditions included complex polyphonic singing, log drums, and various instruments. The Hornbill Festival, held annually in December, now showcases these artistic traditions to visitors from worldwide.</p>

            <h2>Christianity and Cultural Change</h2>
            <p>American Baptist missionaries arrived among the Nagas in the 1870s, beginning one of the most dramatic mass conversions in modern history. By the mid-20th century, most Naga tribes had embraced Christianity, which now claims approximately 90% of the population. Factors favoring conversion included the appeal of literacy and education, Christianity's message against headhunting and tribal warfare, and social prestige associated with the new religion.</p>
            <p>Christianity fundamentally transformed Naga society. Churches replaced morungs as community centers; Christian hymns supplanted traditional songs; and many traditional practices were abandoned as "pagan." Yet Naga Christianity developed distinctively local forms, incorporating traditional aesthetics into church architecture and worship, and maintaining ethnic identity through Christian expression. The tension between preserving heritage and embracing faith continues.</p>

            <h2>The Naga Independence Movement</h2>
            <p>Since India's independence in 1947, Naga nationalists have sought self-determination, waging one of Asia's longest insurgencies. The Naga National Council declared independence in 1947, before India itself became independent. Decades of conflict between Naga rebels and Indian security forces caused tremendous suffering, including documented atrocities and the displacement of populations. Multiple ceasefire agreements have reduced violence without achieving political resolution.</p>
            <p>The central issue remains whether Nagas constitute a distinct nation deserving sovereignty or regional minorities within India and Myanmar. Naga nationalists point to their unique culture, never having been part of any larger state before colonialism. The Indian government offers autonomy within the federal system. Peace negotiations continue intermittently, with the final status of the Naga people remaining unresolved after seven decades of conflict.</p>
