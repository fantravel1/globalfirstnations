            <h2>Who Are the Afar?</h2>
            <p>The Afar (also Danakil) are a Cushitic-speaking pastoral people of approximately 3 million inhabiting one of Earth's most extreme environments—the Afar Triangle where Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Djibouti meet. This region, including the Danakil Depression, features temperatures exceeding 50°C (122°F), active volcanoes, salt flats, and landscapes that resemble another planet. The Afar have adapted to this hostile environment for millennia, extracting salt from desert beds and herding camels, goats, and cattle. Their warrior culture, divided among sultans and clans, historically controlled vital trade routes and resisted external domination.</p>

            <h2>The Danakil Depression</h2>
            <p>The Danakil Depression is among Earth's most inhospitable places—a below-sea-level volcanic zone with temperatures regularly exceeding 50°C, almost no rainfall, active volcanoes, and acid hot springs. Yet Afar have lived here for thousands of years. The landscape's extremity includes Dallol—a hydrothermal field of brilliant colors from mineral deposits, and Erta Ale—a volcano with a permanent lava lake. The depression also holds immense paleoanthropological significance: Lucy (Australopithecus afarensis) was discovered here, making Afar territory central to understanding human evolution.</p>

            <h2>Salt Caravans</h2>
            <p>For centuries, Afar have extracted salt from the Danakil's salt flats—cutting blocks from crystallized deposits in brutal heat, then transporting them by camel caravan to highland Ethiopian markets. The salt trade connected Afar to the broader Ethiopian economy while providing crucial income. Salt blocks served as currency in highland commerce. Though modern transport has reduced caravan importance, the trade continues on smaller scale. The salt caravans represent both economic activity and cultural heritage—the dangerous work requiring exceptional endurance and traditional knowledge passed through generations.</p>

            <h2>Warrior Culture</h2>
            <p>The Afar have historically been renowned warriors, their harsh environment selecting for toughness and martial skills. Clan and sultanate structures organized military and political life. Traditional practices reportedly included killing enemies in battle as a passage to manhood, though such practices have largely ended. The Afar's fierce reputation protected their territory from external control. During the Ethiopian-Eritrean war, Afar areas experienced conflict; Afar movements have sought autonomy from central governments that often neglect their marginalized region. Warrior values persist in cultural memory and social organization.</p>

            <h2>Modern Challenges</h2>
            <p>Contemporary Afar face multiple challenges: division among three countries complicates political representation; climate change threatens already marginal pastoral lands; development projects (including dams on the Awash River) disrupt traditional water access; and conflict in the Horn of Africa affects Afar populations. The 2020-2022 Tigray War spilled into Afar region, displacing hundreds of thousands. Despite these pressures, Afar maintain distinctive identity—their language, Islam, pastoral economy, and social structures persist. How they navigate modernity while preserving cultural heritage in one of Earth's harshest environments demonstrates remarkable adaptation.</p>
