            <h2>Who Are the Diola?</h2>
            <p>The Diola (also Jola, Joola) are an Atlantic-speaking people primarily inhabiting the Casamance region of southern Senegal, with populations also in The Gambia and Guinea-Bissau. They number approximately 700,000-900,000 people. The Diola speak several closely related Jola languages belonging to the Atlantic branch of Niger-Congo. Unlike neighboring Wolof and Mandinka who formed centralized kingdoms, the Diola traditionally maintained decentralized, egalitarian societies organized around village councils and religious shrines. They are renowned for their sophisticated wet rice cultivation in the mangrove-lined estuaries of the Casamance and their preservation of traditional religion longer than most neighboring groups.</p>

            <h2>Rice Cultivation</h2>
            <p>Diola wet rice cultivation in the Casamance estuaries represents one of Africa's most sophisticated indigenous agricultural systems. Using the kajando (a specialized long-bladed spade), Diola men construct elaborate dike systems to control salt water intrusion and manage fresh water flooding for paddy cultivation. This system, developed over centuries without external influence, rivals Asian wet rice techniques in complexity. Rice holds deep spiritual and social significance—it features in rituals, bride prices, and ceremonial exchanges. The paddy landscape, carved from mangrove forests, demonstrates remarkable ecological knowledge and engineering skill, all accomplished through collective labor organized by village councils.</p>

            <h2>Traditional Religion</h2>
            <p>Diola traditional religion centers on ukiin (spirits associated with places, phenomena, and activities) and various shrines where these spirits are propitiated. The awasena (sacred forest shrines) are sites of initiations, healing rituals, and community ceremonies. Religious authority is diffuse, held by various shrine priests and priestesses rather than centralized leadership. The Diola resisted both Islamization and Christianity longer than neighboring groups, and traditional religion remains relatively strong, particularly in rural areas. When conflicts arise, village councils and shrine-based mechanisms provide resolution. This religious system supports the Diola's decentralized, egalitarian social organization.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Diola</h2>
            <p>Modern Diola experience has been shaped by the Casamance conflict, a low-intensity separatist movement that has intermittently caused displacement and disruption since 1982. Casamance's geographic separation from northern Senegal and Diola cultural distinctiveness fuel separatist sentiment among some. Despite the conflict, Diola continue farming and fishing, and Casamance remains an important agricultural region. Islam and Christianity have made inroads, though traditional practices persist. Diola migrate to Dakar for work while maintaining village ties. Environmental changes, including saltwater intrusion and reduced rainfall, threaten rice cultivation. Navigating peace, development, and cultural preservation defines contemporary Diola experience.</p>
