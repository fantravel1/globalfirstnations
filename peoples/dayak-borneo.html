            <h2>Who Are the Dayak?</h2>
            <p>Dayak is a collective term for the indigenous peoples of Borneo, the world's third-largest island shared by Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei. Comprising over 200 ethnic groups speaking distinct languages, the Dayak include the Iban, Kenyah, Kayan, Ngaju, and many others. Once feared as headhunters, today they are recognized as sophisticated forest managers whose traditional knowledge is vital for rainforest conservation.</p>

            <h2>Longhouse Communities</h2>
            <p>The traditional Dayak dwelling is the longhouse (rumah betang or rumah panjang), a communal structure that can extend hundreds of meters and house an entire village. Each family has private quarters (bilik) opening onto a common veranda used for ceremonies, meetings, and daily activities. Longhouses serve as the physical manifestation of community unity. The headman (tuai rumah) mediates disputes and leads communal decisions. Though many Dayak now live in individual houses, longhouses remain important ceremonial centers.</p>

            <h2>Headhunting and Spiritual Beliefs</h2>
            <p>Historical Dayak headhunting was deeply embedded in spiritual beliefs about the power residing in human heads. Heads were taken in warfare to protect communities, ensure rice harvests, and mark important transitions. The practice was suppressed by colonial authorities and Christian missionaries. Today, skull houses remain as cultural artifacts, and the spiritual significance has transformed into other ceremonial practices. Kaharingan, the traditional animist religion, centers on maintaining balance between the seen and unseen worlds.</p>

            <h2>Tattoos and Body Art</h2>
            <p>Dayak tattoo traditions are among the world's most elaborate. Using hand-tapping techniques with wooden sticks and thorns, tattoos marked social status, achievements, and spiritual protection. Designs varied by tribe: the Iban favored throat tattoos and hand motifs, while Kayan women wore intricate arm and leg patterns. Tattoos were believed to light the way to the afterlife. Though missionary influence reduced the practice, a revival movement now recognizes Dayak tattooing as UNESCO-worthy intangible heritage.</p>

            <h2>Forest Stewardship and Modern Challenges</h2>
            <p>Dayak peoples have managed Borneo's rainforests sustainably for millennia through sophisticated systems of land classification, rotational farming, and sacred forest reserves. Their tana' ulen protected areas preserve biodiversity and watershed functions. Today, Dayak communities face severe threats from palm oil plantations, logging, and mining that destroy ancestral lands. Indigenous activists fight for land rights recognition, winning important legal victories while advocating for forest-based sustainable livelihoods.</p>
