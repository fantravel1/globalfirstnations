            <h2>Who Are the Okinawans?</h2>
            <p>The Okinawans, or Ryukyuans, are the indigenous people of the Ryukyu Islands, a chain of islands stretching between Japan and Taiwan. For centuries, the Ryukyu Kingdom was an independent state with its own language, culture, and international relations. Today, approximately 1.4 million people live in Okinawa Prefecture, with many maintaining distinctive cultural traditions despite integration into Japan.</p>
            <p>The Ryukyu Islands served as a crucial maritime crossroads connecting Japan, China, Korea, and Southeast Asia. This position shaped Ryukyuan culture into a unique synthesis of influences, producing distinctive music, architecture, religion, and the martial arts tradition that became known worldwide as karate.</p>

            <h2>The Ryukyu Kingdom</h2>
            <p>The Ryukyu Kingdom (1429-1879) prospered through maritime trade, acting as intermediary between China, Japan, Korea, and Southeast Asian kingdoms. The kingdom paid tribute to Ming and Qing China while developing independent diplomatic relations. Naha's port bustled with traders from across Asia, and Ryukyuan ships sailed as far as Malacca and Siam.</p>
            <p>Royal culture flourished in Shuri Castle, where distinctive architecture blended Chinese and Japanese styles with local innovations. The court developed refined arts including classical dance (called kumi udui), the sanshin music tradition, and elaborate textile arts. UNESCO recognized nine sites of the Ryukyu Kingdom as World Heritage Sites.</p>

            <h2>Language and Identity</h2>
            <p>The Ryukyuan languages—including Okinawan, Miyako, Yaeyama, and others—are related to Japanese but are distinct languages, not dialects. UNESCO classifies several as endangered. Japanese assimilation policies after 1879 suppressed Ryukyuan languages in schools, and many younger Okinawans no longer speak their ancestral tongue fluently.</p>
            <p>Okinawan identity remains complex. Some emphasize distinction from mainland Japan; others focus on integration. The U.S. military presence (occupying Okinawa from 1945-1972 and maintaining large bases today) adds another layer to identity politics. Movements for greater autonomy or even independence periodically emerge, though they remain minority positions.</p>

            <h2>Longevity and Diet</h2>
            <p>Traditional Okinawa gained fame as a "Blue Zone"—a region with exceptionally high concentrations of centenarians. Studies attributed this longevity to diet (low-calorie, plant-rich, featuring sweet potato, tofu, and vegetables), strong social bonds, continued physical activity in old age, and a sense of purpose called ikigai.</p>
            <p>However, post-war dietary changes have eroded these patterns. Younger Okinawans now have among Japan's highest obesity rates, and longevity advantages are diminishing. The Okinawan diet has become a global health phenomenon even as Okinawans themselves increasingly abandon it.</p>

            <h2>Birthplace of Karate</h2>
            <p>Karate ("empty hand") developed in Okinawa, synthesizing indigenous fighting techniques with influences from Chinese martial arts. When the Ryukyu Kingdom banned weapons in the 15th century, commoners refined unarmed combat methods. Training occurred secretly, often disguised as dance.</p>
            <p>The three main styles—Shuri-te, Naha-te, and Tomari-te—emerged from different towns and teachers. In the 20th century, Okinawan masters introduced karate to mainland Japan and eventually the world. Today, millions practice karate globally, though many are unaware of its Okinawan origins distinct from mainland Japanese culture.</p>
