            <h2>Who Are the Tujia People?</h2>
            <p>The Tujia are a major ethnic group of approximately 8 million people inhabiting the mountainous border regions of Hunan, Hubei, Guizhou, and Chongqing in central-south China. Their name means "local people" or "original inhabitants," contrasting with later Han Chinese settlers. The Tujia language belongs to the Tibeto-Burman family, though most Tujia now speak only Chinese. They are known for distinctive traditions including the Hand-Waving Dance, brocade weaving, and "crying marriages." Their mountain homeland includes the spectacular Zhangjiajie National Forest Park.</p>

            <h2>Hand-Waving Dance</h2>
            <p>The Hand-Waving Dance (Baishou Wu) is the Tujia's most distinctive cultural expression—a collective dance performed by hundreds or thousands in synchronized movements depicting agricultural labor, hunting, warfare, and daily life. UNESCO recognized it as intangible cultural heritage. Traditionally performed at festivals and communal gatherings, the dance creates powerful visual spectacle and reinforces community bonds. Participants of all ages join, preserving movements passed through generations. Modern performances range from village celebrations to staged cultural shows, maintaining the tradition while adapting to contemporary contexts.</p>

            <h2>Crying Marriage</h2>
            <p>The "Crying Marriage" (Ku Jia) tradition required brides to cry for extended periods before weddings—sometimes starting a month in advance. The crying, with formalized songs and verses, expressed sorrow at leaving the natal family while also demonstrating the bride's virtue and emotional depth. Mothers, aunts, and sisters joined in ritualized weeping. While genuine grief mixed with performance, the tradition also prepared emotional transition. Modern weddings rarely include extended crying, though symbolic tears may appear in cultural wedding performances. The practice illustrated the profound emotional weight of marriage in traditional society.</p>

            <h2>Xilankapu Brocade</h2>
            <p>Xilankapu is the traditional Tujia brocade—hand-woven textiles with geometric patterns in bold colors, used for bedding, clothing, and ceremonial items. Girls traditionally learned weaving skills essential for marriage preparation. Patterns carry symbolic meanings: dragons for power, phoenixes for beauty, flowers for prosperity. Each region developed distinctive designs. Xilankapu production declined with industrialization but has revived as cultural heritage and tourist craft. Master weavers are recognized as cultural inheritors, and weaving cooperatives provide income while preserving techniques. The brocade represents Tujia aesthetic achievement and feminine artistry.</p>

            <h2>Mountain Homeland</h2>
            <p>The Tujia homeland in the Wuling Mountain range features dramatic karst landscapes, deep gorges, and the sandstone pillars of Zhangjiajie—inspiration for the floating mountains in the film "Avatar." This terrain historically isolated Tujia communities, preserving distinct culture while also limiting economic development. Today, Zhangjiajie's tourism boom transforms the region economically. Tujia cultural performances, food, and crafts cater to millions of visitors. Yet tourism also pressures authenticity—staged culture for external consumption differs from lived community practice. Balancing preservation with development challenges contemporary Tujia communities.</p>
