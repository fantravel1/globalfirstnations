            <h2>Who Are the Navajo?</h2>
            <p>The Navajo, who call themselves Diné ("The People"), are the largest Native American tribe in the United States, numbering approximately 400,000 enrolled members. They inhabit the Navajo Nation—a 27,000 square mile reservation (larger than 10 US states) spanning Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah's Four Corners region. They speak Navajo (Diné bizaad), an Athabaskan language famous for its complexity and its use by WWII Code Talkers. The Navajo developed distinctive culture combining Athabaskan heritage with influences from Pueblo peoples, creating renowned weaving, silversmithing, and ceremonial traditions that define Southwestern Native American culture.</p>

            <h2>Migration and Adaptation</h2>
            <p>Navajo ancestors migrated from northwestern Canada, reaching the Southwest around 1400-1500 CE. They learned agriculture, weaving, and ceremonial practices from Pueblo peoples while maintaining Athabaskan language and some traditions. Spanish contact (16th century) introduced sheep and horses—transforming Navajo economy. Sheep became central; weaving developed into high art. Horse mobility enabled both herding and raiding. By the 18th century, Navajo were formidable presence, distinct from related Apache groups. This adaptability—incorporating useful elements while maintaining core identity—characterizes Navajo cultural resilience.</p>

            <h2>Long Walk and Survival</h2>
            <p>The Long Walk (1864) was Navajo history's defining trauma. Kit Carson's scorched-earth campaign destroyed livestock, crops, and orchards; 8,000-9,000 Navajos were force-marched 300+ miles to Bosque Redondo internment camp. Hundreds died en route; conditions at the camp were devastating. The Treaty of 1868 allowed return to a reduced homeland. This experience—starvation, exile, death, then return—shapes Navajo memory. The reservation expanded through subsequent additions but remains isolated, impoverished, and lacking infrastructure. Survival and rebuilding from this catastrophe demonstrates remarkable resilience.</p>

            <h2>Code Talkers and Modern Era</h2>
            <p>Navajo Code Talkers in WWII used their language as unbreakable military code in Pacific battles—credited with saving thousands of lives. Long classified, their contribution gained recognition (Congressional Gold Medals, 2001). The 20th century brought livestock reduction programs (devastating to economy), boarding schools (cultural suppression), uranium mining (health disasters), and eventually self-governance expansion. The Navajo Nation government—with president, council, and courts—exercises sovereignty over the largest reservation. Coal and uranium provided revenue but environmental costs; transition to solar energy proceeds. Contemporary challenges include poverty, unemployment, health disparities, and infrastructure gaps.</p>

            <h2>Living Culture</h2>
            <p>Navajo culture remains vibrant. The language, though declining among youth, has 170,000 speakers—among the healthiest Native American languages. Traditional ceremonies (nine-night chants, sand paintings) continue for healing and blessing. Weaving and silversmithing produce world-renowned art. The hogan (traditional dwelling) remains culturally significant. Kinship through matrilineal clans structures social relations. The four sacred mountains define homeland boundaries. Modern Navajo navigate between tradition and contemporary life; many maintain ceremonial practice while pursuing education and careers. This living culture—adapted but unbroken—represents Native American survival and renaissance.</p>
