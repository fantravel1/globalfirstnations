            <h2>Who Are the Solomon Islanders?</h2>
            <p>Solomon Islanders comprise the diverse Melanesian peoples of the Solomon Islands, numbering approximately 700,000 across nearly 1,000 islands. They speak over 70 indigenous languages plus Solomon Islands Pijin (a creole serving as lingua franca). Settlement dates back 30,000+ years; distinct island cultures developed varying practices including famous shell money traditions, headhunting (ended by missionaries), and elaborate canoe building. The islands gained independence from Britain in 1978 but experienced ethnic tensions (1998-2003) requiring Australian intervention. Traditional wantok (clan/language group) ties remain powerful alongside modern governance.</p>

            <h2>Shell Money</h2>
            <p>Shell money (particularly the red shell money tafuliae from Malaita) remains in active use—one of the world's surviving traditional currencies. Women dive for shells; specialists manufacture strings of polished shell disks strung on plant fiber. Different shell types serve different purposes: bride price, compensation payments, ceremonial exchanges, and trade. Shell money cannot simply be replaced by cash—its cultural value exceeds its exchange value. Banks in the Solomons accept shell money deposits. The persistence of traditional currency alongside dollars demonstrates how Solomon Islanders maintain cultural economy within globalization.</p>

            <h2>Wantok System</h2>
            <p>The wantok (from "one talk"—those who share language) system structures Solomon society through obligations to clan and language group. Wantok members share resources, provide mutual aid, and support each other's interests. This creates social security networks but also drives nepotism and corruption when extended into government and business. Land belongs to wantok groups, not individuals—creating complex negotiations with logging companies and developers. The tension between wantok obligations and modern governance challenges the nation, as politicians favor their wantok while ethnic tensions (particularly between Guadalcanal and Malaita groups) have caused conflict.</p>

            <h2>The Tensions</h2>
            <p>From 1998-2003, ethnic violence between Guadalcanal islanders and Malaitan settlers displaced 20,000 people and nearly collapsed the state. Underlying issues—land pressure, economic inequality, resentment of Malaitan dominance—exploded into armed conflict. The Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI), led by Australia, restored order from 2003-2017. The conflict demonstrated how customary land tenure, wantok loyalties, and weak state capacity can combine dangerously. Though peace holds, underlying tensions remain—particularly over land, internal migration, and resource distribution. The Tensions, as they're called, shaped contemporary Solomon Islands identity.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Solomons</h2>
            <p>Post-Tensions Solomon Islands has struggled with development—logging revenues declining, limited economic diversification, and continued governance challenges. Climate change threatens low-lying islands; some communities have already relocated. Traditional culture remains vibrant: shell money circulates, customary land tenure dominates, and Christianity (97% Christian) has been thoroughly indigenized. The 2019 switch of diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China brought controversy and development promises. How Solomon Islands balances traditional wantok systems, modern governance, and external influences while maintaining peace defines its ongoing challenge as an independent Melanesian nation.</p>
