            <h2>Who Are the Chukchi?</h2>
            <p>The Chukchi are an indigenous people of the Chukotka Peninsula in the Russian Far East, the region closest to Alaska across the Bering Strait. Numbering approximately 16,000, they speak Chukchi, a Chukotko-Kamchatkan language. The Chukchi traditionally divided into two distinct groups: the coastal Chukchi (Anqallyt), who were maritime hunters focusing on whales, walruses, and seals, and the inland Chukchi (Chavchu), who were nomadic reindeer herders. Despite different economies, both groups shared language, culture, and identity. The Chukchi are known for their successful resistance to Russian imperial expansion and their sophisticated adaptations to one of Earth's harshest environments.</p>

            <h2>Two Economies, One People</h2>
            <p>Coastal Chukchi developed maritime hunting culture similar to their Yupik neighbors across the Bering Strait. They hunted whales, walruses, and seals from skin boats, living in semi-subterranean houses (yaranga) with walrus-hide roofs. Whale hunting was communal, requiring cooperation and elaborate rituals. Inland Chukchi were nomadic reindeer herders, moving with their herds across the tundra and living in portable yarangas. Some families maintained thousands of reindeer. The two groups traded extensively—coastal groups exchanged sea mammal products for reindeer meat and hides. Intermarriage was common. This complementary system allowed Chukchi to exploit the full range of their harsh environment. Both groups shared animistic beliefs, with shamans mediating relationships with spirits.</p>

            <h2>Resistance and Incorporation</h2>
            <p>The Chukchi are remarkable for successfully resisting Russian colonial expansion for over a century. Russian Cossacks reached Chukotka in the 1640s, but Chukchi warriors, using coordinated cavalry tactics on reindeer, repeatedly defeated Russian expeditions. The 1730s-40s saw particularly fierce warfare; the Chukchi's military success was so complete that the Russian Empire, in 1778, effectively acknowledged defeat, establishing trade relations rather than demanding tribute. The Chukchi remained essentially autonomous until Soviet collectivization in the 1930s. Soviet policies forced herders into collective farms and coastal hunters into collective fishing operations. Boarding schools separated children from families. Yet Chukchi culture proved resilient.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Chukchi</h2>
            <p>Modern Chukchi communities face the familiar challenges of post-Soviet indigenous peoples: economic dislocation, alcoholism, and cultural erosion, alongside efforts at revitalization. Some reindeer herding continues, though at reduced scale compared to Soviet-era collectives. Coastal villages maintain sea mammal hunting, with whale hunting conducted under international quotas. The Chukchi language is endangered, with Russian dominant among younger generations. Yet cultural pride persists—Chukchi artists, writers, and activists work to maintain traditions. The Chukchi writer Yuri Rytkheu achieved international recognition. Traditional festivals and ceremonies continue. Climate change affects both marine and tundra ecosystems, threatening subsistence practices. The Chukchi demonstrate how indigenous peoples can maintain identity through dramatic political changes while facing new environmental uncertainties.</p>
