            <h2>Who Are the Ama?</h2>
            <p>The **Ama** (海女, literally "sea women") are traditional Japanese women freedivers who have harvested seafood—particularly abalone, sea urchins, and historically pearls—from coastal waters for at least **2,000 years**. Concentrated along the Shima Peninsula in Mie Prefecture and other coastal areas of Japan and Korea (where they are called **haenyeo**), the Ama represent one of the world's oldest diving traditions. At their peak in the early 20th century, perhaps **30,000 Ama** worked Japan's coasts; today only about **2,000** remain, mostly elderly women, making this a critically endangered cultural practice. The tradition of women diving while men remained ashore in boats developed from practical advantages—women's higher body fat provides better cold water insulation—and evolved into a distinctive occupation passed from mother to daughter.</p>

            <h2>The Art of Freediving</h2>
            <p>Ama dive without breathing apparatus, relying on trained breath-holding capacity developed over years of practice. Experienced Ama can hold their breath for **two minutes or more**, diving to depths of **10-25 meters** in cold water. Traditional equipment included only a cotton loincloth (later replaced by wetsuits), face mask, weight belt, and collecting basket. Before wetsuits, Ama relied on a distinctive breathing technique—the **isobue** or "sea whistle"—a sharp exhale upon surfacing that helps prevent hyperventilation and extends diving endurance. Dives are organized around the **amagoya**—rest huts where divers warm themselves by fires between diving sessions, sharing meals and maintaining community bonds. The physically demanding work requires years of training; girls traditionally began learning as teenagers, diving into their 70s or beyond.</p>

            <h2>Pearls, Abalone, and Economy</h2>
            <p>While the Ama are often called "pearl divers," natural pearls were always rare; their primary harvest has been **abalone** (awabi), sea urchins, seaweed, and other shellfish. The Mikimoto Pearl Company famously employed Ama to tend cultured pearl oyster beds in the early 20th century, linking them permanently with the pearl industry in popular imagination. Today, Ama primarily harvest abalone (prized in Japanese cuisine and increasingly scarce) and other seafood. Strict seasonal regulations and catch limits—maintained through traditional community management—ensure sustainable harvesting. The **Ama economy** functioned through fishing cooperatives; women controlled their catch and income, giving them unusual economic independence in traditional Japanese society. This female-dominated profession created distinctive gender dynamics in Ama communities.</p>

            <h2>Spiritual and Cultural Traditions</h2>
            <p>The Ama tradition is deeply interwoven with **Shinto** beliefs and practices. Before diving, Ama pray at coastal shrines for safety and good catches. The **seiman** (five-pointed star) and **doman** (grid pattern) symbols are traditionally worn or marked on equipment to ward off evil spirits and sharks. The sea itself is sacred, inhabited by **kami** (spirits) requiring proper respect. The annual **Shirahama Festival** and other ceremonies maintain spiritual connections to the ocean. Community rituals reinforce bonds among divers; the amagoya serves as social as well as practical space. Cultural pride has increased as the practice gains recognition: UNESCO included the Ama in considerations for Intangible Cultural Heritage, and domestic tourism brings visitors eager to experience authentic Ama culture.</p>

            <h2>An Endangered Tradition</h2>
            <p>The Ama face existential crisis. The average age of active divers exceeds **65 years**; young women rarely enter the profession, preferring education and urban careers. Abalone populations have declined due to ocean warming and environmental degradation. The physical demands deter many. Yet preservation efforts multiply: museums document Ama history and techniques; tourism programs allow visitors to observe (and sometimes try) diving; and some communities actively recruit new divers. In Korea, the **haenyeo** tradition received UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage status in 2016, potentially protecting related Japanese practices. Whether the Ama tradition survives depends on making it viable for younger generations—balancing preservation with adaptation, honoring the past while creating sustainable futures for Japan's legendary women of the sea.</p>
