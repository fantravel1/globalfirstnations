            <h2>Who Are the Kota?</h2>
            <p>The Kota (Ko·v) are a small Dravidian-speaking community of the Nilgiri Hills in Tamil Nadu, South India, numbering approximately 2,000-2,500. They speak Kota, a Dravidian language related to but distinct from neighboring Toda and Badaga. The Kota traditionally occupied a unique economic niche in the Nilgiri inter-tribal system—they were artisans, musicians, and craftspeople who provided essential goods and services to the neighboring Toda, Badaga, and Kurumba. Their expertise in ironsmithing, pottery, basket weaving, carpentry, and especially music made them indispensable to the hill communities. Kota music, featuring distinctive trumpet-like instruments, accompanied the ceremonial life of all Nilgiri tribes.</p>

            <h2>Artisan Economy</h2>
            <p>The traditional Nilgiri economy featured a remarkable inter-tribal division of labor. The Toda were pastoral, keeping sacred buffalo; the Badaga were agricultural; the Kurumba were forest gatherers with ritual specialist roles; and the Kota were artisans and musicians. Kota made agricultural implements, pottery, baskets, ropes, and other essential items for neighboring communities. They also raised crops and livestock, unlike the purely pastoral Toda. Most distinctively, Kota musicians performed at ceremonies of all the hill tribes—their music was essential to Toda funerals, Badaga festivals, and other rituals. This service role brought social subordination alongside economic integration.</p>

            <h2>Music and Ceremony</h2>
            <p>Kota music is the most elaborate musical tradition of the Nilgiri tribes. The ensemble features the ko·l (a double-reed instrument similar to an oboe), do·bar (frame drums), and a distinctive brass trumpet. Different musical modes accompany different ceremonies—funerals, the annual god ceremony (Varalmi), and performances for neighboring tribes. Musical knowledge was traditionally restricted to certain families, transmitted from father to son. The Kota annual ceremony cycle, featuring elaborate rituals, feasting, and days of music, remains central to community life. These ceremonies reinforce Kota identity and social bonds while honoring deities and ancestors. The musicological complexity has attracted scholarly attention and efforts at documentation.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Kota</h2>
            <p>Modern Kota face the challenges of small population and changing circumstances. The traditional inter-tribal economy has broken down; Kota artisanship competes with manufactured goods, and their service role to other communities has diminished. Their small population (concentrated in seven villages) makes cultural transmission fragile. Yet Kota culture persists—the annual ceremonies continue, music is still performed, and community identity remains strong. The Kota language, while endangered, has dedicated speakers. Cultural documentation efforts have recorded musical traditions. Unlike some neighbors, the Kota have not experienced dramatic religious conversion. Their situation illustrates both the vulnerability of small specialist communities when traditional economies change and the possibility of cultural persistence through community cohesion and adaptation.</p>
