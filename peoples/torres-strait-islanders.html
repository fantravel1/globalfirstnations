            <h2>Who Are the Torres Strait Islanders?</h2>
            <p>Torres Strait Islanders are the indigenous Melanesian peoples of the Torres Strait Islands—over 270 islands between Australia's Cape York Peninsula and Papua New Guinea. Approximately 38,000 identify as Torres Strait Islander, with many more of mixed Aboriginal and Islander heritage. They speak two main indigenous languages: Kalau Lagaw Ya (Western-Central) and Meriam Mìr (Eastern), plus Torres Strait Creole. Culturally distinct from Aboriginal Australians, Torres Strait Islanders are seafarers with strong Melanesian connections, elaborate dance traditions, and the famous Mabo case that transformed Australian law. The 1992 Eddie Mabo native title victory originated here.</p>

            <h2>Ailan Kastom</h2>
            <p>Torres Strait Islander culture (ailan kastom) reflects Melanesian heritage with unique developments. Society is organized into clans and totems; complex kinship systems govern relationships and obligations. Traditional religion centered on hero-cults—ancestral beings like Malo and Bomai whose laws governed behavior. Christianity, introduced in 1871 (celebrated annually as The Coming of the Light), has been thoroughly incorporated; most Islanders are devout Christians while maintaining cultural practices. Gardening, fishing, and hunting sea creatures (especially dugong and turtle—culturally significant foods) sustain traditional economy alongside modern employment.</p>

            <h2>Dance and Ceremony</h2>
            <p>Torres Strait Islander dance is among Australia's most spectacular cultural expressions. Dancers wear elaborate headdresses (dari) featuring cassowary and other feathers, with specific designs indicating clan and island. Dance drums (warup) drive complex rhythms; performers enact stories of ancestors, sea creatures, and cultural narratives. Each island maintains distinct dance traditions. The Torres Strait Islander flag, featuring the dari headdress, was designed by the late Bernard Namok. Dance groups perform nationally and internationally, representing Islander culture while maintaining sacred elements restricted to initiated performers.</p>

            <h2>The Mabo Case</h2>
            <p>Eddie Koiki Mabo, from Mer (Murray Island), brought the case that overturned terra nullius—the legal fiction that Australia was unoccupied before British settlement. The 1992 Mabo v Queensland decision recognized that traditional land ownership (native title) could survive British annexation. This transformed Australian property law and enabled land claims across the country. Mabo died months before the decision; he never saw its impact. The Mer people's documented gardening and land inheritance provided evidence that contradicted colonial assumptions. The Mabo case demonstrates how Torres Strait Islanders changed Australian law through persistence and justice-seeking.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Torres Strait</h2>
            <p>Torres Strait Islanders face unique challenges: their islands lie at sea level, making climate change existential—some communities are already planning relocation as seas rise. The border with Papua New Guinea creates complex governance; traditional trade and family connections span the national boundary. Many Islanders live on the Australian mainland, particularly in Queensland, while maintaining connections to home islands. Health and education disparities persist despite distinct Islander programs. The Torres Strait Regional Authority provides self-governance. How Islanders maintain culture, address climate threats, and navigate between Islander and Australian identities shapes their future.</p>
