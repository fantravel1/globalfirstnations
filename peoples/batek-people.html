            <h2>Who Are the Batek?</h2>
            <p>The Batek are a Semang (Negrito) Orang Asli group of Peninsular Malaysia, numbering approximately 1,500-2,000 people. They speak Batek, an Aslian language of the Austroasiatic family. The Batek traditionally inhabited the lowland rainforests of Pahang and Kelantan, particularly the area now encompassed by Taman Negara National Park. They are one of the few groups in Southeast Asia who maintained a fully nomadic hunting and gathering lifestyle into the late 20th century. The Batek are known for their egalitarian social organization, extensive forest knowledge, and spiritual relationship with the rainforest environment.</p>

            <h2>Hunter-Gatherer Life</h2>
            <p>Traditional Batek economy centered on hunting (with blowpipes and darts), fishing, and gathering forest products including wild yams, fruits, honey, and rattan. Small bands of 15-50 people moved frequently, establishing temporary camps and exploiting different forest zones seasonally. This mobility, combined with intimate forest knowledge, allowed sustainable use of resources without depleting them. Division of labor was flexible; both men and women contributed to subsistence. The Batek also traded forest products (rattan, aromatic woods) with Malay traders for metal tools and other goods. This lifestyle persisted into recent decades, though sedentarization has increased.</p>

            <h2>Egalitarian Society</h2>
            <p>Batek society is remarkably egalitarian—there are no chiefs, leaders have only temporary influence based on skill, and individuals are free to join or leave groups. Sharing is obligatory; food must be distributed to all camp members. Accumulation of property or status is discouraged. Gender relations are unusually equal; women and men have comparable autonomy and voice. Decisions are made by consensus after discussion. This egalitarianism is enforced through ridicule of anyone acting superior and the freedom to simply leave groups whose members become overbearing. The Batek exemplify egalitarian band society, providing anthropological insights into social organization without hierarchy.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Batek</h2>
            <p>Modern Batek face complex changes. Taman Negara's designation as a national park both protected their forest habitat and restricted their hunting rights. Some Batek have settled in villages, working in the park as guides or engaging in agriculture. Others maintain semi-nomadic patterns. The tension between conservation restrictions and indigenous rights creates difficulties—Batek are sometimes arrested for hunting in areas they have used for generations. Government resettlement schemes pressure sedentarization. Yet the Batek have proven adaptable, moving between forest camps and settled life as circumstances allow. Their forest knowledge now has value in ecotourism. How they negotiate conservation, development, and cultural continuity shapes their future.</p>
