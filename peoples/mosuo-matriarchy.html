            <h2>Who Are the Mosuo?</h2>
            <p>The Mosuo are an ethnic group of approximately 40,000 people living near Lugu Lake on the border of Yunnan and Sichuan provinces in southwestern China. They are famous worldwide for their matrilineal society, where lineage and property pass through the female line, and for their unique "walking marriage" (zou hun) practice that separates romantic partnership from household economics.</p>
            <p>Officially classified by the Chinese government as part of the Naxi ethnic minority, the Mosuo maintain a distinct identity, language, and cultural system. Their social organization has attracted intense anthropological interest as one of the world's few surviving matrilineal societies, though tourism and modernization increasingly impact traditional ways.</p>

            <h2>Matrilineal Society</h2>
            <p>In traditional Mosuo society, the household is centered on the grandmother. Children belong to their mother's household and take her family name. Property, including the family home, passes from mother to daughters. The oldest capable woman typically serves as the dabu, or head of household, managing finances, assigning work, and making major family decisions.</p>
            <p>Men remain in their birth households throughout life, contributing labor and income to their sisters and mothers rather than to wives. Men's primary family responsibilities are to their sisters' children—their nieces and nephews—rather than to biological children who belong to the mother's household. This arrangement means divorce doesn't exist because couples never form joint households.</p>

            <h2>Walking Marriage</h2>
            <p>The walking marriage system allows adults to engage in romantic relationships without cohabitation. A man visits his partner at night, walking to her home after dark and leaving before dawn to return to his own family home for daytime work. Such relationships can last years or lifetimes, but neither partner has economic obligations to the other.</p>
            <p>Relationships are based purely on affection and can be ended by either party simply by no longer arranging visits. Women control their own sexuality and reproduction without being economically dependent on male partners. Children are raised communally by the mother's extended family, with multiple adults sharing childcare responsibilities.</p>

            <h2>Tibetan Buddhist Faith</h2>
            <p>The Mosuo practice Tibetan Buddhism blended with older animist traditions. Monasteries around Lugu Lake have historically played important community roles, with many families sending at least one son to become a monk. The Buddhist concept of non-attachment may philosophically support the separation of romantic love from property relationships.</p>
            <p>Alongside Buddhism, the Mosuo maintain the Daba religion, an indigenous shamanic tradition with priests who conduct funerals, blessings, and communicate with spirits. Natural features around Lugu Lake are considered sacred, including the goddess mountain Gemu that overlooks the lake. Annual festivals honor these sacred sites with elaborate rituals.</p>

            <h2>Tourism and Change</h2>
            <p>Since the 1990s, Lugu Lake has become a major tourist destination, marketed as the "Kingdom of Women." Tourist development has brought roads, hotels, and economic opportunities but also challenges to traditional culture. Some fear the walking marriage tradition is becoming a tourist spectacle rather than a living practice.</p>
            <p>Young Mosuo increasingly receive education outside the community and may choose different lifestyles. Some adopt conventional marriage, especially those working in cities. Government policies promoting "civilized" family structures add pressure. Mosuo intellectuals and cultural workers struggle to maintain authentic traditions while adapting to modernity.</p>
