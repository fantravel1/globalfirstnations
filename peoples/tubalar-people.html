            <h2>Who Are the Tubalar?</h2>
            <p>The Tubalar (also Tuba-kizhi) are a small indigenous Turkic people of the northern Altai Republic, Russia, numbering approximately 1,500-2,000. They inhabit the mountainous forested region between the Biya and Katun rivers, particularly in the Choya and Turochak districts. They speak a dialect of Northern Altai, a Turkic language. The Tubalar were traditionally taiga hunters, gatherers, and fishermen, culturally and economically similar to the Chelkan and Kumandin rather than the pastoralist southern Altai groups. Post-Soviet recognition has established them as a distinct indigenous small-numbered people.</p>

            <h2>Mountain-Taiga Homeland</h2>
            <p>The Tubalar homeland in the northern Altai features steep, forested mountains with river valleys cutting through the ranges. This landscape—mountain taiga rather than steppe—shaped Tubalar economy and culture. Hunting dominated the traditional economy: sable and squirrel furs provided trade goods; elk, maral (Siberian red deer), and bear provided meat and other products. Pine nut gathering was economically crucial. Fishing in the Katun, Biya, and their tributaries supplemented the diet. Beekeeping developed with Russian influence. Horses were kept for transport but herding was minimal compared to southern Altai groups. This economic pattern connected Tubalar to other northern Altai peoples.</p>

            <h2>Oral Traditions</h2>
            <p>The Tubalar share the rich oral tradition of Altai peoples, including epic narratives (kai), songs, and folktales. Kai is a form of throat singing used to perform heroic epics—a tradition related to Tuvan and Mongolian throat singing but with distinctive Altai characteristics. These epics preserve cultural heroes, cosmological beliefs, and historical memories. Shamanic narratives and beliefs informed understanding of the natural and supernatural worlds. Soviet-era suppression weakened but did not destroy these traditions; post-Soviet cultural revival has renewed interest. How much oral tradition can be transmitted to younger generations who primarily speak Russian remains uncertain.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Tubalar</h2>
            <p>Modern Tubalar live in the scenic northern Altai, an area increasingly attractive to Russian tourists. Tourism provides some economic opportunities but also raises concerns about land pressure and cultural commodification. Traditional hunting and gathering continue for subsistence though regulated by authorities. The Tubalar language is endangered; perhaps 200-300 speakers remain, mostly elderly. Russian is the everyday language for most Tubalar. Recognition as an indigenous small-numbered people provides legal protections and some support for cultural programs. Whether these resources suffice to maintain Tubalar as a distinct people—or whether assimilation into the broader Altai or Russian population will continue—shapes their future.</p>
