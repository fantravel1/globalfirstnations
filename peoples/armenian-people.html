            <h2>Who Are the Armenians?</h2>
            <p>The Armenians are an ancient Indo-European people numbering approximately 10 million—3 million in the Republic of Armenia, and 7+ million in diaspora communities worldwide (Russia, USA, France, Lebanon, Iran, Syria, Argentina). They speak Armenian, a unique Indo-European language branch with its own distinct alphabet created in 405 CE. Armenia became the world's first Christian state (301 CE), and the Armenian Apostolic Church remains central to national identity. The Armenian Genocide (1915-1923) killed 1-1.5 million and created the modern diaspora. Armenians maintain strong identity through church, language, and historical memory.</p>

            <h2>Ancient Civilization</h2>
            <p>Armenian civilization emerged in the Armenian Highlands (eastern Anatolia, South Caucasus) by the 6th century BCE, likely from the ancient kingdom of Urartu. The Kingdom of Armenia reached greatest extent under Tigranes the Great (95-55 BCE), briefly rivaling Rome. Christianity became state religion under King Tiridates III (301 CE)—the world's first. The unique Armenian alphabet (38 letters) was created by Mesrop Mashtots (405 CE), enabling distinctive literature, theology, and identity preservation. Located between Roman/Byzantine and Persian empires, Armenia experienced frequent invasion and partition, yet maintained cultural continuity through church and script.</p>

            <h2>Genocide and Diaspora</h2>
            <p>The Armenian Genocide (1915-1923) was the systematic extermination of 1-1.5 million Armenians by the Ottoman government—deportations, death marches, massacres. The historical Armenian homeland in eastern Anatolia was emptied; survivors fled to Syria, Lebanon, Russia, and globally. Turkey denies genocide characterization, creating ongoing diplomatic conflict. International recognition has gradually spread; the US recognized it in 2019. The genocide shaped modern Armenian identity: collective trauma, diaspora formation, and demands for recognition. April 24 (Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day) is observed worldwide. This catastrophe explains why more Armenians live outside Armenia than within.</p>

            <h2>Soviet and Post-Soviet Era</h2>
            <p>Eastern Armenia (Russian-controlled since 1828) became Soviet Armenia (1920). Soviet rule brought industrialization, education, and relative stability—but also political repression. The Nagorno-Karabakh movement (1988) demanding unification with Armenia sparked conflict with Azerbaijan. Independence (1991) brought war, economic collapse, and blockade by Turkey and Azerbaijan. Armenia prevailed in the first war (1992-1994) but lost the 2020 war, surrendering most territories. The 2023 Azerbaijani offensive displaced Nagorno-Karabakh's entire Armenian population—120,000+ people, ending 3,000 years of Armenian presence there.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Armenia</h2>
            <p>Modern Armenia is a small, landlocked, resource-poor country with closed borders to two of four neighbors (Turkey, Azerbaijan). The 2018 Velvet Revolution brought democratic government under Nikol Pashinyan, but military defeats have undermined his position. Economic dependence on Russia, diaspora remittances, and IT sector development characterize the economy. The diaspora maintains political influence, cultural institutions, and financial support. Church remains identity anchor. How Armenia navigates hostile regional environment, builds sustainable economy, and maintains national identity despite territorial losses and demographic pressures shapes this ancient people's precarious but resilient future.</p>
