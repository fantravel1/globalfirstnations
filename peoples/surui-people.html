            <h2>Who Are the Suruí Paiter?</h2>
            <p>The Suruí Paiter (often just called Suruí) are an indigenous Tupian people of Rondônia state, Brazil, numbering approximately 1,500-1,800. They speak Paiter, a Tupian language. First contacted in 1969, the Suruí experienced devastating epidemics that reduced their population from an estimated 5,000 to around 250. Since then, they have made a remarkable demographic recovery. The Suruí have gained international recognition for their innovative use of technology—including Google Earth, GPS mapping, and carbon credit programs—to protect their territory from illegal logging and deforestation.</p>

            <h2>Contact and Catastrophe</h2>
            <p>The Suruí were contacted in 1969 during road construction through their territory. The contact was catastrophic—within five years, epidemics (particularly measles and flu) had killed an estimated 90% of the population. Survivors faced further losses from violence and displacement. The Suruí lost elders holding traditional knowledge; social structures were severely disrupted. Yet from this devastation, they have rebuilt—population has increased sevenfold, and cultural revitalization efforts have restored some traditional practices. The speed and completeness of both the destruction and recovery make the Suruí a dramatic case of indigenous resilience.</p>

            <h2>Technology for Forest Defense</h2>
            <p>Under the leadership of Chief Almir Suruí, the Suruí developed innovative partnerships with technology companies to protect their territory. Working with Google, they created detailed maps of their lands using GPS and Google Earth, documenting illegal logging and deforestation in real-time. This "Google Earth Outreach" project became a model for indigenous technology use. The Suruí also developed one of the world's first indigenous-led carbon credit projects, receiving payments for preserving forest carbon that would otherwise be released through deforestation. These innovations have brought international attention and resources, though also internal debates about commercialization of indigenous territory.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Suruí</h2>
            <p>Modern Suruí face ongoing threats from illegal loggers, land grabbers, and regional development pressures. Chief Almir Suruí has received death threats for his activism. Internal divisions over development strategies, carbon credits, and relations with outside organizations create community tensions. The Suruí language is taught in community schools; Portuguese is also widely spoken. Traditional ceremonies and practices have been partially revived. Coffee cultivation and sustainable forestry provide some income. How the Suruí balance their high-profile international advocacy role with community cohesion and territorial defense shapes this technologically innovative people's future.</p>
