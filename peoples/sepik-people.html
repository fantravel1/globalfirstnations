            <h2>Who Are the Sepik Peoples?</h2>
            <p>The Sepik peoples comprise numerous distinct ethnic groups inhabiting the Sepik River basin in northern Papua New Guinea—one of the world's great river systems and one of Melanesia's richest cultural areas. The population of the Sepik region numbers approximately 400,000, speaking over 250 distinct languages from multiple language families. Despite linguistic diversity, Sepik cultures share certain features, particularly their renowned artistic traditions. The monumental spirit houses (haus tambaran), elaborate masks, ancestral figures, and decorated objects of the Sepik are among the world's most celebrated examples of indigenous art, collected by museums worldwide and influencing Western artists including the Surrealists.</p>

            <h2>Art and Spirit Houses</h2>
            <p>Sepik art is inseparable from spiritual life. The haus tambaran (spirit house) served as the ceremonial center of villages—elaborately decorated structures where sacred objects were kept, initiations performed, and men gathered. Access was restricted; women and uninitiated could not enter. These houses contained masks representing spirits and ancestors, carved figures, painted facades, and ritual objects. Different Sepik groups developed distinctive styles—the curvilinear faces of the Middle Sepik, the aggressive hook figures of the Abelam, the elongated forms of the Lower Sepik—all displaying extraordinary technical skill and spiritual power. Art was not decorative but functional, embodying and activating spiritual forces essential to community well-being.</p>

            <h2>Initiation and Social Life</h2>
            <p>Male initiation was central to traditional Sepik society. Boys underwent painful scarification rituals, receiving crocodile-like scars representing rebirth from ancestral spirits (the crocodile is a powerful spiritual symbol throughout the region). Initiation transmitted sacred knowledge and transformed boys into men. Women had parallel but separate spiritual traditions. Social organization varied among groups but often featured ranked status, "big men" who achieved influence through generosity and ritual knowledge, and elaborate exchange relationships. The riverine environment supported fishing, sago processing, and gardening. Warfare and headhunting featured in some societies, with enemy heads serving ritual purposes. German colonial and later Australian administration suppressed warfare and some practices.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Sepik</h2>
            <p>Modern Sepik communities balance tradition and change. Art remains vital—carvers produce work both for traditional purposes and for sale to collectors and tourists, creating economic opportunities while raising questions about authenticity and cultural commodification. Some spirit houses have been rebuilt and ceremonies continue, though Christianity has transformed religious life. Traditional knowledge transmission has been disrupted by schooling and social change. Languages face varying degrees of endangerment. Political and economic development challenges affect the region. Climate change and environmental pressures affect the river system. Yet Sepik cultures remain vibrant, their artistic traditions globally celebrated and locally maintained. The Sepik demonstrates how indigenous art can maintain cultural significance while engaging with global markets.</p>
