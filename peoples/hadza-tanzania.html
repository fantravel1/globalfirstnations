            <h2>Who Are the Hadza?</h2>
            <p>The Hadza are one of the last populations on Earth living primarily as hunter-gatherers. Numbering only about 1,300, with 300-400 still practicing traditional foraging, they inhabit the woodlands around Lake Eyasi in northern Tanzania. The Hadza speak a click language unrelated to any other known language family, suggesting extreme antiquity and isolation. Their lifestyle offers unique insights into how all humans lived before the agricultural revolution 10,000 years ago.</p>

            <h2>Foraging Lifestyle</h2>
            <p>Hadza foraging involves a gendered division of labor. Men hunt with bows and arrows, pursuing everything from birds to giraffes, and collect wild honey—a prized food obtained by climbing tall baobabs while smoking out bees. Women gather tubers, berries, baobab fruit, and other plant foods using digging sticks. Children begin contributing food around age five. The diet varies seasonally but typically provides adequate nutrition with only 4-6 hours of "work" daily—leaving abundant time for rest, socializing, and play. No food storage means no wealth accumulation.</p>

            <h2>Egalitarian Social Structure</h2>
            <p>Like other foraging societies, the Hadza are radically egalitarian. There are no chiefs, no formal leaders, and no inherited wealth or status. Camp composition changes frequently as individuals move between groups based on preference. Meat from large kills is distributed throughout camp; hoarding is socially unacceptable. Men and women have autonomy over their activities and relationships. This mobility and sharing ethic prevents anyone from accumulating power over others—a social structure anthropologists believe characterized most of human prehistory.</p>

            <h2>The Click Language</h2>
            <p>Hadzane, the Hadza language, contains click consonants and is a language isolate—unrelated to any other language including neighboring click languages like those of the San or the Sandawe. This isolation suggests the Hadza have inhabited their region for tens of thousands of years, preserving linguistic features that disappeared elsewhere. The language lacks words for numbers beyond three or four, reflecting a lifestyle without need for precise counting. Efforts to document Hadzane accelerate as the number of speakers declines.</p>

            <h2>Threats to Survival</h2>
            <p>The Hadza face existential pressure from encroaching pastoralists and farmers who convert their hunting lands to cattle grazing and agriculture. Tourism brings income but disrupts traditional patterns and raises dependency concerns. Climate change affects the availability of wild foods. Some Hadza have transitioned to farming or wage labor, while others resist, recognizing that their land and lifestyle are inseparable. Conservation organizations work with Hadza communities to secure land rights, understanding that protecting Hadza culture also protects biodiversity.</p>
