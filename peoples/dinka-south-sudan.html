            <h2>Who Are the Dinka?</h2>
            <p>The Dinka (Jieng) are South Sudan's largest ethnic group, comprising approximately 4.5 million people—roughly 35% of the country's population. They speak Dinka, a Nilotic language with multiple dialects. The Dinka are quintessential pastoralists, with cattle central to their culture, economy, and cosmology. Known for exceptional height (among the world's tallest people), scarification practices, and elaborate poetry praising cattle, the Dinka fought for South Sudan's independence from Sudan. Since independence in 2011, Dinka have dominated South Sudan's politics—contributing to tensions with other ethnic groups, particularly the Nuer.</p>

            <h2>Cattle Culture</h2>
            <p>Cattle define Dinka existence. Cows provide milk (the dietary staple), blood for rituals, hides, and social currency—bride wealth is paid in cattle; disputes are resolved through cattle exchange; a man's identity ties to his "personality ox." Boys receive their own ox upon initiation, composing songs praising its coloring and horns. Men know intimate details of each animal's lineage. Camps follow seasonal patterns—wet season settlements, dry season cattle camps near rivers. This pastoral system, practiced for millennia, faces pressures from conflict, oil extraction, and development that threaten traditional land use.</p>

            <h2>Initiation and Scarification</h2>
            <p>Dinka men traditionally undergo initiation involving facial scarification—parallel lines cut across the forehead (gaar) marking transition to adulthood and warrior status. The process, conducted without anesthesia, tests courage and marks Dinka identity permanently. Women receive different patterns. Initiation includes instruction in warrior values, cattle husbandry, and social responsibilities. While some urban Dinka have abandoned scarification, it remains common in rural areas and is reviving among some diaspora youth seeking cultural connection. The scars visibly distinguish Dinka from other ethnic groups.</p>

            <h2>Civil War and Crisis</h2>
            <p>The Dinka endured decades of civil war between Sudan and what became South Sudan (1955-1972, 1983-2005). After South Sudan's independence in 2011, fighting between Dinka-aligned President Salva Kiir and Nuer Vice President Riek Machar in 2013 triggered new civil war lasting until 2018. Ethnically targeted massacres, mass displacement, and famine affected millions. Though the Dinka's numerical dominance makes them politically powerful, their association with government forces has also made them targets. South Sudan remains fragile; ethnic tensions continue shaping its troubled politics.</p>

            <h2>The Lost Boys</h2>
            <p>The "Lost Boys of Sudan"—approximately 20,000 young Dinka and Nuer boys who fled the 1980s civil war—became internationally known after trekking thousands of miles to Ethiopian and Kenyan refugee camps. Many were eventually resettled in the United States, Australia, and elsewhere. Their story of survival, adaptation, and diaspora identity has been widely documented. Some returned to South Sudan after independence; others remained abroad, maintaining transnational connections. The Lost Boys represent both the devastating human costs of conflict and remarkable resilience and adaptation.</p>
