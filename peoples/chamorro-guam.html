            <h2>Who Are the Chamorro?</h2>
            <p>The Chamorro (CHamoru) are the indigenous people of the Mariana Islands—Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). Numbering approximately 65,000 in Guam, 20,000 in CNMI, and 90,000+ in the US mainland, Chamorros were among the first Austronesian peoples to settle Remote Oceania some 4,000 years ago. Their unique Austronesian language and culture—featuring advanced seafaring, latte stone architecture, and matrilineal social organization—was nearly destroyed by Spanish colonization beginning in 1668. Today, Chamorros navigate complex identity as US citizens in unincorporated territories seeking greater self-determination.</p>

            <h2>Latte Stone Culture</h2>
            <p>Ancient Chamorro civilization is distinguished by latte stones—paired pillars (haligi) topped by capstones (tasa) that supported raised wooden structures. Found throughout the Marianas, these megalithic remains represent sophisticated engineering and social organization. The largest latte, on Tinian, weigh over 30 tons. Latte likely served as foundations for elite houses or men's houses (though some suggest mortuary functions). The latte period (900-1700 CE) represented Chamorro civilization's height before Spanish contact. Today, latte stone imagery is ubiquitous in Chamorro identity—appearing on flags, logos, and as cultural symbols.</p>

            <h2>Spanish Colonization</h2>
            <p>Spanish colonization, beginning with Magellan's 1521 landing and intensifying after the 1668 Jesuit mission, devastated Chamorro society. The Spanish-Chamorro Wars (1672-1698) and introduced diseases reduced the population from an estimated 50,000-100,000 to under 4,000. Spain forcibly relocated Chamorros from outer islands to Guam, destroyed traditional practices, and imposed Catholicism. By the 18th century, "pure" Chamorro culture was largely extinct—today's Chamorro culture is a syncretic blend of indigenous, Spanish, and later influences. This colonial trauma and resilience shapes contemporary Chamorro identity.</p>

            <h2>Military Colonization</h2>
            <p>Spain ceded Guam to the US after the 1898 Spanish-American War; Germany bought the Northern Marianas. After Japanese occupation in WWII (including brutal treatment of Chamorros), the US took control of all the Marianas. Guam remains an unincorporated US territory; CNMI is a US commonwealth. The US military controls about 30% of Guam, making it a strategic hub with limited Chamorro political power. Chamorros are US citizens but cannot vote for president; Guam's delegate has no congressional vote. Debates continue over decolonization—independence, statehood, free association, or status quo.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Chamorro</h2>
            <p>Modern Chamorros maintain distinct identity despite colonial history. The CHamoru language, though endangered, is taught in schools and used in cultural events. Traditional practices—especially food culture (fiestas featuring kelaguen, red rice, kadon pika), respect for elders, and inafa'maolek (harmony/reciprocity)—remain strong. The latte stone symbolizes Chamorro resilience. Political movements advocate for decolonization and indigenous rights—a 2020 federal court ruling blocked a Chamorro-only self-determination plebiscite. Climate change threatens low-lying areas. How Chamorros achieve self-determination while preserving culture within American political structures remains their central challenge.</p>
