            <h2>Who Are the Chamorro?</h2>
            <p>The Chamorro (CHamoru) are the indigenous people of the Mariana Islands, including Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) in the western Pacific. Approximately 65,000 Chamorro live on Guam (where they are now a minority), 15,000 in the CNMI, and tens of thousands more in diaspora, particularly California. The Chamorro are among the Pacific's earliest settlers, arriving around 2000 BCE and developing a sophisticated maritime culture. After Spanish colonization beginning in 1668 and subsequent American administration, the Chamorro navigate complex relationships between indigenous identity and their status as US nationals.</p>

            <h2>The Latte Stone Legacy</h2>
            <p>Latte stones are iconic megalithic structures unique to the Mariana Islands—mushroom-shaped pillars that served as foundations for ancient Chamorro buildings. Created from coral and limestone, some latte stones weigh tons and reach heights over 4 meters. These engineering achievements demonstrate the complexity of ancient Chamorro society, which built oceangoing canoes, cultivated rice, and developed stratified social systems. Today, latte stones serve as powerful symbols of Chamorro identity, appearing on flags, seals, and as monuments throughout the islands.</p>

            <h2>Spanish Colonial Impact</h2>
            <p>Spanish colonization from 1668 devastated the Chamorro through disease, forced relocation, and violent suppression of resistance during the Spanish-Chamorro Wars (1672-1698). The population declined from perhaps 35,000 to fewer than 5,000. Survivors were concentrated into fewer villages and converted to Catholicism. This dramatic population collapse and cultural suppression profoundly shaped Chamorro identity. Yet Chamorro language, customs, and identity persisted, blending with Spanish influences to create the culture that exists today. Catholicism became deeply embedded in Chamorro life.</p>

            <h2>Military Colonialism</h2>
            <p>Guam became a US territory in 1898, and today hosts massive American military installations occupying over a quarter of the island. During World War II, Chamorro endured brutal Japanese occupation and liberation battles that destroyed their homeland. Despite sacrificing for the US, Chamorro have never been granted voting rights in presidential elections or full representation in Congress. Proposals to increase military presence continue to raise concerns about environmental damage, land loss, and cultural impact. Debates over Guam's political status range from statehood to independence.</p>

            <h2>Language and Cultural Revival</h2>
            <p>The Chamorro language (Finakpo'on CHamoru) faced decline as English became dominant, but revitalization efforts have grown. Immersion programs, university courses, and community initiatives work to ensure language transmission. Cultural practices including dance, weaving, and traditional navigation are being recovered and taught. The Chamorro concept of "inafa'maolek" (making things right, interdependence) guides community values. Fiestas, combining Catholic feast days with Chamorro hospitality, remain central to community life, featuring traditional foods like kelaguen and red rice.</p>
