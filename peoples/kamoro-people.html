            <h2>Who Are the Kamoro?</h2>
            <p>The Kamoro (also Kamrau or Mimika) are a Papuan people of the southwestern coastal lowlands of Indonesia's Papua Province, inhabiting the swampy regions around Timika and Mimika Regency. Numbering approximately 15,000-18,000, they speak Kamoro, an Asmat-Kamoro family language closely related to the neighboring Asmat. The Kamoro are renowned for their elaborate woodcarving traditions, including ancestor poles (mbitoro) and spirit boards (yamate), which rival Asmat art in quality. Their territory includes the Freeport-McMoRan mining complex, one of the world's largest gold and copper mines, which has dramatically transformed their environment and lives.</p>

            <h2>Art Traditions</h2>
            <p>Kamoro artistic traditions parallel the better-known Asmat. Mbitoro (ancestor poles) are tall carved posts commemorating deceased individuals, erected during elaborate ceremonial cycles. Yamate (spirit boards) feature complex designs representing ancestors and mythological beings. Drums, canoe prows, paddles, and everyday objects receive elaborate carved decoration. Unlike some Pacific art traditions focused on abstraction, Kamoro carving emphasizes narrative scenes and recognizable figures. The Catholic Church, arriving in the mid-20th century, initially suppressed traditional ceremonies but later supported cultural revival. Today, Kamoro carving is produced both for ceremony and for sale, with quality pieces entering international art markets while tourist items provide local income.</p>

            <h2>Freeport Mine Impact</h2>
            <p>The Freeport-McMoRan Grasberg mine, operating since the 1970s, has transformed Kamoro life. The mine—one of the world's largest gold and copper operations—generates billions in revenue but has brought environmental devastation: rivers choked with tailings, forests destroyed, traditional fishing and sago grounds contaminated. The Kamoro have received some employment and compensation but remain marginalized; promised benefits have often failed to materialize. The contrast between mine wealth and Kamoro poverty generates resentment. Health problems linked to environmental contamination affect communities. Human rights concerns have been raised about security force abuses. The Kamoro situation exemplifies how extractive industries can transform indigenous territories while local peoples bear environmental costs without proportionate benefits.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Kamoro</h2>
            <p>Modern Kamoro communities navigate between traditional swamp-based livelihoods and the mine-transformed landscape. Sago harvesting and fishing continue where possible, but environmental damage has reduced food security. Some Kamoro work for the mine or related services; others produce art for sale. Catholic Christianity is nearly universal, but traditional ceremonies have experienced revival with church support. Cultural festivals showcase carving, dance, and performance. Advocacy organizations challenge Freeport's practices and demand greater community benefit. Youth face the choice of traditional life in diminished environments or seeking education and employment in a cash economy that often excludes them. The Kamoro represent indigenous peoples whose territories contain globally valuable resources—their future depends on whether extraction can ever coexist with indigenous rights and environmental sustainability.</p>
