            <h2>Who Are the Koryak?</h2>
            <p>The Koryak are an indigenous people of the Russian Far East, primarily inhabiting the Kamchatka Peninsula and the surrounding regions of Magadan Oblast. Numbering approximately 8,000-9,000, they speak Koryak, a Chukotko-Kamchatkan language related to Chukchi. Like the Chukchi, the Koryak traditionally divided into two distinct economic groups: the coastal Nymylan (maritime hunters of sea mammals) and the interior Chavchuvat (nomadic reindeer herders). The name Koryak derives from the Koryak word for reindeer, reflecting the animal's importance to their culture. The Koryak developed sophisticated adaptations to the volcanic, mountainous landscape of Kamchatka and its rich marine resources.</p>

            <h2>Maritime and Herding Cultures</h2>
            <p>Coastal Koryak communities lived in semi-subterranean houses, hunting whales, seals, and sea lions, and fishing for salmon that filled Kamchatka's rivers in enormous runs. Dogs were essential for transportation in coastal regions. Interior Koryak maintained large reindeer herds, living nomadically in portable tents (yaranga) as they followed their animals across the tundra. Annual migrations could cover hundreds of kilometers. The two groups were economically complementary, trading sea mammal products for reindeer meat and hides. Spiritual practices were animistic, with elaborate ceremonies ensuring success in hunting and herding. The Koryak shared many cultural elements with the Chukchi, including language structure, ceremonial practices, and social organization.</p>

            <h2>Colonial History</h2>
            <p>Russian Cossacks reached Koryak territory in the mid-17th century, seeking tribute (yasak) in furs. The Koryak, like the Chukchi, resisted Russian expansion, though generally less successfully. Epidemics devastated coastal communities. The Russian-American Company exploited Koryak labor. By the 19th century, Russian Orthodox missionaries had converted many Koryak, though traditional beliefs persisted. Soviet collectivization fundamentally transformed Koryak society, ending nomadism for many and concentrating populations in villages. Reindeer herding was organized into collective farms; coastal economies were disrupted. The Soviet collapse brought further dislocation as state support systems dissolved. Reindeer herds declined dramatically in the 1990s.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Koryak</h2>
            <p>Modern Koryak communities work to maintain cultural identity amid economic challenges. The Koryak language is severely endangered, with most speakers elderly and Russian dominant among younger generations. Language revitalization programs operate in schools. Some reindeer herding continues, though at reduced scale. Salmon fishing remains important both for subsistence and commercial purposes. The Koryak Autonomous Okrug, which had provided some self-governance, was merged into Kamchatka Krai in 2007. Indigenous rights organizations advocate for Koryak interests regarding land, resources, and cultural preservation. Traditional crafts, dance groups, and cultural festivals maintain connections to heritage. Kamchatka's ecotourism potential offers economic opportunities that may help sustain Koryak communities and cultures into the future.</p>
