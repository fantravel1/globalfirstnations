            <h2>Who Are the Buyi People?</h2>
            <p>The Buyi (also Bouyei) are a Tai-Kadai speaking ethnic group of approximately 3 million people, primarily inhabiting Guizhou Province's southern and southwestern regions. Closely related to the Zhuang linguistically and culturally, the Buyi have inhabited their mountain and river homeland for millennia. They are known for indigo-dyed textiles, stone architecture adapted to karst landscapes, and residence near some of China's most spectacular waterfalls, including Huangguoshu Falls. Their agricultural practices, bronze drum traditions, and shamanistic rituals reflect ancient heritage maintained through relative geographic isolation.</p>

            <h2>Wax-Resist Dyeing</h2>
            <p>The Buyi are masters of wax-resist batik dyeing—applying melted wax in intricate patterns to cloth before indigo dyeing, creating blue-and-white designs when wax is removed. Patterns include flowers, birds, fish, and geometric motifs with symbolic meanings. Women traditionally made all family textiles through labor-intensive processes: growing cotton, spinning, weaving, dyeing, and embroidering. Batik clothing identifies Buyi women; tourists prize the textiles as handicrafts. UNESCO recognized related Miao/Buyi batik techniques. While commercial production increases, traditional home production continues in villages.</p>

            <h2>Stone Villages</h2>
            <p>Buyi villages in karst limestone country feature distinctive stone architecture—walls, roofs, roads, and even furniture fashioned from locally abundant stone. Villages like Shitou Zhai (Stone Head Village) are constructed almost entirely of gray limestone, creating a unified aesthetic that blends with the rocky landscape. Narrow stone lanes wind between houses; stone drums and mills serve daily needs. This architecture represents practical adaptation to available materials. Stone villages have become tourist attractions, though modernization pressures traditional building practices.</p>

            <h2>Bronze Drums</h2>
            <p>Bronze drums, cast since the first millennium BCE, hold sacred significance for the Buyi and related Tai peoples. These large drums, decorated with sun motifs and geometric patterns, were used in rituals, festivals, and funerals—beaten to communicate with ancestors and spirits. Archaeological finds show bronze drum traditions spanning over 2,000 years. While ritual use has declined, drums appear in museums and ceremonial contexts. The drums connect modern Buyi to ancient regional civilizations that produced sophisticated bronze metallurgy before Chinese incorporation.</p>

            <h2>Festival Traditions</h2>
            <p>The Buyi celebrate numerous festivals tied to agricultural cycles. The Third Month Third (San Yue San) festival involves ancestor worship, singing competitions, and young people's courtship. The Sixth Month Sixth (Liu Yue Liu) celebrates the rice transplanting season with offerings to the rice goddess. New Year celebrations include ancestor rituals and community gatherings. Festivals maintain community bonds and transmit cultural knowledge through songs, dances, and rituals. Tourism has amplified some celebrations while potentially transforming their meaning for younger generations.</p>
