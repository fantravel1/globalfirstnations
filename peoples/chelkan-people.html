            <h2>Who Are the Chelkan?</h2>
            <p>The Chelkan (also Chalkandu) are a small indigenous Turkic people of the northern Altai Republic, Russia, numbering approximately 1,000-1,200. They inhabit the forested valleys of the Lebed River (a tributary of the Biya) and surrounding taiga in the Turochak district. They speak a dialect of Northern Altai, a Turkic language. Like other northern Altai groups, the Chelkan were traditionally taiga hunters and gatherers with some fishing, rather than steppe pastoralists like southern Altai peoples. Soviet-era policies grouped them as "Altaians," but post-Soviet recognition has established them as a distinct indigenous group.</p>

            <h2>Taiga Adaptation</h2>
            <p>The Chelkan developed a distinct taiga-adapted lifestyle quite different from the pastoralism of their southern Altai neighbors. Hunting provided the primary livelihood—sable, squirrel, and other fur-bearers for trade; elk, deer, and bear for subsistence. Pine nut (kedrovyi orekh) gathering was economically and nutritionally important. Fishing in the Lebed and other rivers supplemented the diet. Small-scale cattle keeping developed with Russian influence but remained secondary. Horses served for transport rather than herding. This hunting-gathering economy with limited animal husbandry connected the Chelkan to other taiga peoples of Siberia while their Turkic language linked them to the broader Altai world.</p>

            <h2>Recognition Struggles</h2>
            <p>The Chelkan's status as a distinct ethnic group was suppressed during the Soviet period when they were administratively merged into the broader Altai (Altai-kizhi) category. This merger ignored significant differences between the taiga-dwelling northern groups and the pastoralist southern groups. Post-Soviet reforms brought opportunities for ethnic recognition; the Chelkan successfully petitioned for separate status, gaining recognition as an indigenous small-numbered people of the North (one of Russia's protected indigenous categories). This status provides some rights regarding traditional land use and cultural preservation, though enforcement remains challenging.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Chelkan</h2>
            <p>Modern Chelkan live primarily in the villages of Kurmach-Baigol, Suranash, and other settlements in the Turochak district of the Altai Republic. Hunting and gathering continue for subsistence though regulated by Russian authorities. Pine nut harvesting provides some cash income. Tourism development in the Altai brings limited opportunities. The Chelkan language is endangered; perhaps 300-400 speakers remain, most elderly. Youth typically speak Russian. Cultural programs work to document and revive traditions. The small population and remote location provide both protection (less development pressure) and challenge (limited resources). How this tiny taiga people maintains identity as a distinct group shapes their uncertain future.</p>
