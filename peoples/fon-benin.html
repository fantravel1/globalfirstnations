            <h2>Who Are the Fon?</h2>
            <p>The Fon are the largest ethnic group in Benin, numbering approximately 3.5 million (40% of Benin's population), with additional communities in Togo and Nigeria. They speak Fon, a Gbe language of the Niger-Congo family. The Fon founded the powerful Kingdom of Dahomey (1600-1900), renowned for its military power, elaborate palace culture, and the famous Amazons (women warriors). Most significantly, the Fon are the originators of Vodun—the religious system that, through the Atlantic slave trade, became Haitian Vodou, Brazilian Candomblé, and Cuban Santería. Benin has declared Vodun a national religion; January 10 is National Vodun Day.</p>

            <h2>Kingdom of Dahomey</h2>
            <p>The Kingdom of Dahomey (1600-1900) was one of West Africa's most powerful states, built on military conquest, centralized authority, and the slave trade. The kingdom's wealth derived partly from selling war captives to European slavers—a history Dahomey's descendants now reckon with. Dahomey was famous for its Mino (Amazons)—elite women warriors who served the king and fought in battle. The elaborate palace at Abomey (now UNESCO World Heritage) demonstrated royal power through relief sculptures, throne rooms, and ritual spaces. French conquest in 1894 ended the kingdom; its history shapes contemporary Beninese identity.</p>

            <h2>Vodun Religion</h2>
            <p>Vodun (source of "voodoo") is the Fon traditional religion—a complex system of deities (vodun), ancestor spirits, and ritual practices. Major vodun include Dan (serpent, associated with wealth), Sakpata (earth, disease), and Mami Wata (water, beauty). Priests and priestesses undergo long initiation; possession by vodun during ceremonies is central. Vodun shrines, divination, and healing practices permeate Fon life. The religion traveled to the Americas with enslaved Africans, transforming into related traditions while maintaining core elements. Benin's official recognition of Vodun as national heritage has sparked revival, challenging the stigma attached during Christian missionary and colonial periods.</p>

            <h2>Slave Trade Legacy</h2>
            <p>Ouidah, the Fon coastal city, was one of Africa's major slave-trading ports—over a million Africans were shipped from here to the Americas. The Route des Esclaves (Slave Route), ending at the "Door of No Return" on the beach, is now a memorial. Dahomey's role in the slave trade—capturing and selling war prisoners—creates uncomfortable history: Fon ancestors were both enslaved and enslavers. Benin has acknowledged this history, hosting commemorations and heritage tourism connecting diaspora descendants with ancestral homeland. The relationship between Fon Vodun and diaspora religions draws African Americans and Brazilians to Benin seeking spiritual roots.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Fon</h2>
            <p>Modern Fon dominate Benin's politics, economy, and culture. The capital Porto-Novo is in Fon territory; Fon language serves as a lingua franca in southern Benin. Vodun practice continues openly since the 1990s democratic transition ended restrictions. Annual festivals, particularly the Ouidah Vodun Festival (January 10), celebrate religious heritage while attracting diaspora visitors and tourists. Artists and scholars document traditions; Vodun-inspired contemporary art gains international recognition. How Fon navigate their complex history—as founders of a powerful kingdom, participants in the slave trade, and preservers of Vodun traditions—shapes their contribution to Benin's identity.</p>
