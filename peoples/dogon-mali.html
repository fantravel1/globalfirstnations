            <h2>Who Are the Dogon?</h2>
            <p>The Dogon are an ethnic group inhabiting the Bandiagara Escarpment and surrounding plateau in central Mali. Numbering around 800,000, they are renowned for their spectacular cliff dwellings, elaborate masked ceremonies, and complex cosmological knowledge that allegedly includes information about the star Sirius and its invisible companion. Their cultural landscape, villages, and traditions are recognized as UNESCO World Heritage, representing one of Africa's most distinctive cultural traditions.</p>

            <h2>The Bandiagara Cliffs</h2>
            <p>The Dogon settled the dramatic Bandiagara Escarpment—a 150-kilometer sandstone cliff rising 500 meters from the plains—around the 14th century, likely fleeing Islamization and slave raids. Villages cling to cliff faces and cluster at the base, incorporating caves and dwellings of the earlier Tellem people. Granaries with distinctive pointed roofs dot the landscape. The clifftop plateau and plains below are intensively farmed using sophisticated water management. This cultural landscape, continuously inhabited for 700 years, represents remarkable human adaptation to challenging terrain.</p>

            <h2>Masks and the Dama Ceremony</h2>
            <p>Dogon masked ceremonies, particularly the dama funeral rites, are among Africa's most elaborate ritual performances. Over 78 distinct mask types represent animals, people, abstract concepts, and mythological beings. The spectacular sirige mask can reach six meters tall. Masks emerge from sacred groves to dance, mediating between living and dead during dama ceremonies held periodically to honor recently deceased. Dancers perform athletic leaps and dramatic movements, their identities hidden by costumes and masks. Women are forbidden from seeing unmasked dancers or entering sacred areas.</p>

            <h2>Cosmology and the Sirius Mystery</h2>
            <p>Dogon cosmology describes creation through the god Amma and complex symbolic systems involving twin beings, cosmic eggs, and elaborate origin narratives. Anthropologist Marcel Griaule reported that Dogon elders possessed knowledge of Sirius B, an invisible companion star discovered by Western astronomy only in the 19th century. This "Sirius mystery" sparked speculation about ancient astronaut contacts. However, most scholars now believe the information came from contact with European visitors before Griaule's research, or represents misinterpretation of Dogon symbolism. Regardless, Dogon astronomical traditions remain sophisticated and culturally significant.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Challenges</h2>
            <p>The Dogon face severe security challenges as jihadist insurgency and intercommunal violence destabilize central Mali. Tourism, once important for the local economy, has collapsed due to insecurity. Climate change affects agricultural productivity. Young people migrate to cities, threatening knowledge transmission. Yet Dogon communities maintain ceremonies and traditions where security permits. International organizations work to protect cultural heritage sites from both conflict damage and deterioration. The Dogon demonstrate how ancient traditions persist amid contemporary crises.</p>
