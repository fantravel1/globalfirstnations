            <h2>Who Are the Nivkh?</h2>
            <p>The Nivkh (also known historically as Gilyak) are an indigenous people of Sakhalin Island and the lower Amur River region in the Russian Far East. Numbering approximately 4,500-5,000, they speak Nivkh, a language isolate unrelated to any known language family—a linguistic mystery suggesting ancient, isolated development in the region. The Nivkh developed a sophisticated maritime and riverine culture centered on salmon fishing, sea mammal hunting, and dog breeding. Their unique position between continental Asia and the Pacific islands created cultural connections with both Siberian and Ainu peoples. The Nivkh are among the few peoples worldwide whose traditional economy incorporated dog sledding, salmon fishing, and seal hunting in equal measure.</p>

            <h2>Salmon and Sea Mammal Economy</h2>
            <p>The Nivkh economy centered on the magnificent salmon runs of the Amur River and Sakhalin Island streams. Multiple salmon species provided food for humans and dogs; salmon were caught in weirs, nets, and by spear. Fish were dried, smoked, and fermented for year-round consumption. Salmon skin was processed into clothing—a distinctive Nivkh tradition shared with Amur River peoples. Beyond salmon, Nivkh hunted seals, sea lions, and occasionally whales in coastal waters. These marine mammals provided oil, meat, and skins. The annual cycle followed fish runs and marine mammal movements. Dogs played crucial roles: as sled animals for winter transport and as hunting partners. The Nivkh bred large, powerful dogs and maintained complex relationships with them.</p>

            <h2>Bear Ceremony</h2>
            <p>The Nivkh Bear Festival (Cha-Khaf-Lerkh) was among the most elaborate bear ceremonies in the North Pacific region. Cubs were captured and raised in the village for two to three years, treated as honored guests and considered messengers to the spirit world. During the festival, the bear was ceremonially sacrificed and its spirit sent to the bear ancestors with gifts and messages. The festival involved elaborate rituals, feasting, and community gathering. Similar bear ceremonies existed among the Ainu and other North Pacific peoples, suggesting ancient shared traditions. Soviet authorities suppressed the bear festival as "primitive"; it largely disappeared by the mid-20th century. Some revival efforts have occurred, though the ceremony's full complexity may be lost.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Nivkh</h2>
            <p>Modern Nivkh live primarily in Sakhalin Oblast and Khabarovsk Krai. The Soviet period brought forced sedentarization, collectivization of fishing, and suppression of traditional practices. Oil and gas development on Sakhalin Island (including the Sakhalin-2 project) has dramatically affected Nivkh territories and traditional fishing grounds; pollution and industrial activity damage the salmon streams essential to Nivkh life. The Nivkh language is critically endangered; perhaps 200-500 fluent speakers remain, nearly all elderly. Cultural revival efforts include language documentation, ethnographic research, and some ceremonial revivals. Environmental activism has emerged as Nivkh communities fight to protect traditional territories from industrial development. The Nivkh face the challenge of maintaining cultural identity while their traditional environment is transformed by one of the world's largest oil and gas projects.</p>
