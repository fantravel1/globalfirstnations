            <h2>Who Are the Luo?</h2>
            <p>The Luo (also Joluo) are a Nilotic ethnic group numbering approximately 6 million, primarily in western Kenya around Lake Victoria (where they are Kenya's third-largest ethnic group) and northern Tanzania. They speak Dholuo, a Nilotic language related to languages spoken across the Nile basin—reflecting their migration from southern Sudan centuries ago. The Luo are famous for their fishing traditions on Lake Victoria, their distinctive music (especially the nyatiti lyre), and prominent political figures including President Barack Obama's father. Unlike many Kenyan groups, the Luo traditionally did not practice circumcision, a distinction that has marked ethnic boundaries.</p>

            <h2>Migration and Settlement</h2>
            <p>The Luo migrated from the Nile Valley (modern South Sudan) into the Lake Victoria region between the 15th and 18th centuries—part of broader Nilotic movements. They displaced or absorbed earlier Bantu and Cushitic populations, establishing along the lake and rivers. Unlike pastoralist Nilotes (like Maasai), the Luo adopted fishing and agriculture as primary livelihoods. Their migration history connects them to other Luo-speaking peoples: the Acholi and Lango of Uganda, the Shilluk of South Sudan. This Nilotic heritage distinguishes Luo from surrounding Bantu groups and shapes their cultural practices and identity.</p>

            <h2>Music and Benga</h2>
            <p>Luo musical traditions, particularly the nyatiti (eight-stringed lyre) and ohangla percussion music, are foundational to Kenyan popular music. The nyatiti, played during ceremonies and storytelling, requires years to master. From these roots emerged Benga music in the 1960s—Kenya's most influential popular genre—blending traditional rhythms with electric guitars. Benga stars like D.O. Misiani and Shirati Jazz achieved national fame. Luo musicians continue shaping Kenyan and East African music. Song and poetry are central to Luo culture, used for praise, satire, and social commentary—skills transferred to modern political oratory.</p>

            <h2>Politics and Opposition</h2>
            <p>The Luo have been central to Kenyan politics, often in opposition. Founding figure Jaramogi Oginga Odinga led opposition to Jomo Kenyatta's government; his son Raila Odinga has been Kenya's most prominent opposition leader for decades, running for president multiple times. This opposition stance, combined with ethnic voting patterns, has sometimes excluded Luo from power—generating grievances about marginalization. Ethnic violence, particularly post-election violence in 2007-2008, has targeted Luo communities. The relationship between Luo political identity, ethnic competition, and national integration remains a defining issue in Kenyan democracy.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Luo</h2>
            <p>Modern Luo navigate economic challenges (particularly in fishing communities as Lake Victoria fish stocks decline), political engagement, and cultural preservation. Kisumu, the regional capital, is Kenya's third-largest city but lags economically behind Nairobi. Luo diaspora in Nairobi and abroad maintain connections. Education is highly valued; many Luo are prominent in professions and academia. Barack Obama's Kenyan heritage (his father was Luo from Kogelo) brought global attention. Traditional practices like funeral ceremonies (which can last weeks and require significant expense) continue. How Luo balance their distinctive identity with national integration in multi-ethnic Kenya shapes their future.</p>
