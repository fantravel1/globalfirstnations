            <h2>Who Are the Luo?</h2>
            <p>The Luo are a Nilotic ethnic group of approximately 7 million people, primarily in Kenya (around Lake Victoria) and Tanzania, with related groups (Acholi, Alur, Lango) in Uganda and South Sudan. They speak Dholuo, a Nilotic language. Unlike neighboring Bantu peoples, the Luo trace origins to Nilotic migrations from the upper Nile region. They practice mixed economy—fishing, farming, and cattle-keeping. The Luo are Kenya's third-largest ethnic group, historically in political opposition to Kikuyu dominance. Barack Obama's father was Luo, bringing international attention to this community.</p>

            <h2>Lake Victoria Life</h2>
            <p>Lake Victoria (Nam Lolwe in Dholuo) shapes Luo culture. Fishing has traditionally been central—the tilapia and Nile perch catches supporting communities and providing trade goods. Traditional fishing used canoes, nets, and traps; modern commercial fishing has transformed the industry. Settlement patterns follow the lakeshore; the lake provides water, protein, and transportation. Environmental challenges—declining fish stocks, water hyacinth invasions, pollution—threaten this lake-based economy. The Luo relationship with Lake Victoria exemplifies how water bodies shape cultural identity, economy, and daily life for lakeside peoples.</p>

            <h2>Music and Culture</h2>
            <p>Luo music features distinctive instruments—the nyatiti (eight-string lyre), orutu (single-string fiddle), and various drums. Benga music, originating from Luo communities, became one of Kenya's most popular genres, featuring driving guitar rhythms. Musicians like D.O. Misiani popularized benga nationally. Luo funeral customs are elaborate, with night-long vigils and performances. The disco matanga (funeral disco) phenomenon combines traditional mourning with contemporary celebration. Music remains central to Luo identity—expressing emotions, marking occasions, and providing social commentary that sometimes carries political weight.</p>

            <h2>Kenyan Politics</h2>
            <p>The Luo have been central to Kenyan politics while often in opposition. Jaramogi Oginga Odinga challenged the Kikuyu-dominated government; his son Raila Odinga has been Kenya's perennial opposition leader and presidential candidate. The Luo-Kikuyu rivalry has shaped national politics; ethnic violence, particularly in 2007-2008 post-election crisis, targeted Luo communities. Political marginalization—despite population size—generates Luo grievances. Raila's 2022 electoral defeat continued patterns of Luo near-misses for presidency. This political role makes Luo identity inseparable from national political dynamics and ethnic competition.</p>

            <h2>The Obama Connection</h2>
            <p>Barack Obama Sr., father of the 44th U.S. President, was Luo from Kogelo village in western Kenya. This connection brought unprecedented international attention to Luo heritage. Obama's Kenyan family became globally known; his grandmother Sarah Obama was a beloved figure until her death in 2021. Kogelo has become a tourist destination. While Obama Jr. had limited contact with his father (who died in 1982), his Kenyan/Luo heritage features in his memoirs. The Obama connection represents an unexpected globalization of Luo identity—a small Kenyan ethnic group linked to American presidential history.</p>
