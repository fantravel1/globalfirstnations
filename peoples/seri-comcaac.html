            <h2>Who Are the Seri?</h2>
            <p>The Seri, who call themselves Comcáac ("the people"), are an indigenous group of approximately 900 people living along the central coast of Sonora, Mexico, on the eastern shore of the Sea of Cortez (Gulf of California). They are one of the smallest and most distinct indigenous groups in North America, maintaining a unique language isolate and cultural traditions adapted to desert coastline life.</p>
            <p>For thousands of years, the Comcáac lived as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers and fishers, moving seasonally between coastal camps and desert uplands. Their territory included Tiburón Island—the largest island in Mexico—which remains their spiritual homeland. Despite centuries of colonial pressure, the Seri preserved their language and many cultural practices.</p>

            </div>

            <h2>Unique Language</h2>
            <p>The Seri language (cmiique iitom) is a language isolate—not related to any other known language in the world. Linguists believe it represents an ancient tongue that survived while related languages went extinct, possibly preserved by the Comcáac's geographic isolation and resistance to assimilation.</p>
            <p>The language contains remarkable complexity, including elaborate systems for classifying plants and animals, sophisticated directional terms oriented to the sea, and vocabulary reflecting deep ecological knowledge. All Comcáac speak their language, and community efforts including a dictionary project and school programs work to ensure its survival.</p>

            <h2>Desert Coastal Ecology</h2>
            <p>The Comcáac developed intimate knowledge of one of Earth's most productive marine ecosystems. The Sea of Cortez, which Jacques Cousteau called "the world's aquarium," provided abundant marine resources: sea turtles, fish, shellfish, sea lions, and seabirds. The adjacent Sonoran Desert offered cactus fruit, mesquite beans, game, and over 400 plant species used for food and medicine.</p>
            <p>Traditional Seri ecological knowledge (TEK) has attracted scientific attention. Ethnobotanist Richard Felger documented Seri use of over 90 plant species, many with previously unknown applications. Their knowledge of sea turtle biology contributed to conservation programs. The Comcáac maintain custodianship of ecologically important territory in the Midriff Islands region.</p>

            <h2>Sea Turtle Relations</h2>
            <p>Sea turtles held central importance in traditional Comcáac life and continue as powerful cultural symbols. The caguama (loggerhead turtle) and green turtle provided food, oil, and materials for millennia. Elaborate rituals surrounded turtle hunting, and specific songs were sung to honor the animals.</p>
            <p>As turtle populations crashed from overharvesting by commercial fisheries, the Comcáac became conservation partners. They monitor nesting beaches and have reduced traditional hunting while advocating for protection of their ancestral waters. The relationship demonstrates how indigenous communities can shift from consumption to conservation while maintaining cultural connections to important species.</p>

            <h2>Ironwood Carving Art</h2>
            <p>Since the 1960s, the Comcáac have developed a distinctive art form: animal sculptures carved from ironwood (palo fierro), one of the world's hardest woods. These carvings depict sea turtles, dolphins, pelicans, and other local wildlife with remarkable detail and polish. What began as tourist curios has developed into recognized fine art.</p>
            <p>Ironwood carving has become economically important, with skilled carvers earning substantial income. However, overharvesting of slow-growing ironwood trees raises sustainability concerns. Some carvers have shifted to other materials, and conservation programs promote sustainable harvesting practices.</p>
