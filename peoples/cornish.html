            <h2>Who Are the Cornish?</h2>
            <p>The Cornish are the Celtic inhabitants of <strong>Cornwall</strong> (Kernow), the southwestern peninsula of England, with a distinct cultural identity and revived language. Cornwall was the last stronghold of Celtic Britain, resisting Anglo-Saxon conquest until the 9th century. The <strong>Cornish language</strong> (Kernewek), a Brythonic Celtic tongue related to Welsh and Breton, died as a community language by the late 18th century but has been successfully revived since the 20th century, now spoken by approximately 3,000+ people. Historically, Cornwall's economy centered on <strong>tin mining</strong>—the region supplied much of Europe's tin from Bronze Age through the 20th century, creating distinctive mining culture and expertise exported globally. Traditional Cornish culture includes unique customs: <strong>hurling</strong> (ancient ball game), Furry Dance in Helston, gorsedd ceremonies (bardic gatherings), distinctive cuisine including pasties, saffron cake, and cream teas, and strong Methodist religious traditions. Cornwall maintains separate identity from England, recognized as a Celtic nation alongside Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Brittany, and Isle of Man. Political movements advocate for Cornish devolution or autonomy, though Cornwall remains part of England without special constitutional status. In 2014, Cornish people gained recognition as a <strong>national minority</strong> under European Framework Convention, acknowledging distinct cultural identity.</p>

                <strong>Language Revival Success:</strong> Cornish is one of the world's most successful language revival stories! After dying out completely as a native language by 1777, dedicated revival efforts beginning in the early 1900s have created thousands of new speakers and established Cornish-medium education!
            </div>

            <h3>Language Revival and Cultural Renaissance</h3>
            <p>The Cornish language extinction and revival represents remarkable cultural determination. Kernewek declined under English pressure from the 16th-18th centuries, with the last reputed native speaker, Dolly Pentreath, dying in 1777. However, scholars preserved written records including medieval miracle plays and religious texts. Revival began with Henry Jenner's 1904 <em>Handbook of the Cornish Language</em>, followed by Robert Morton Nance's <strong>Unified Cornish</strong> standard in the 1920s. The language attracted cultural revivalists who created new literature, established language societies, and taught Cornish to new generations. Controversies emerged over which historical period to base revival (Medieval vs. Late Cornish), leading to multiple competing standards. The 2008 <strong>Standard Written Form</strong> (Kernowek Standard) attempted reconciliation. Today, approximately 3,000-5,000 people have some Cornish knowledge, with several hundred fluent speakers, Cornish-medium playgroups and classes, annual festivals, and media presence. UNESCO reclassified Cornish from "extinct" to "critically endangered" in 2010, acknowledging revival success while recognizing fragility.</p>

            <h3>Mining Heritage and Global Diaspora</h3>
            <p>Cornwall's identity ties deeply to <strong>mining heritage</strong>. The region's tin and copper deposits created sophisticated mining culture spanning 4,000 years. Cornish miners developed world-leading expertise in hard-rock mining, creating innovations including the Cornish engine (steam-powered pump) and safety systems. When Cornish mining declined in the 19th century, thousands of Cornish miners emigrated globally, establishing Cornish communities in Australia, South Africa, Mexico, Chile, Canada, and the United States. These diaspora communities maintained Cornish identity through societies, Cousin Jack associations (term for Cornish miners), and cultural traditions. The <strong>Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape</strong> became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2006, recognizing the region's mining heritage. Abandoned mines, engine houses, and mining villages remain iconic landscape features. Modern Cornwall has transitioned economically to tourism, fishing, agriculture, and creative industries, though mining heritage remains central to cultural identity.</p>

            <h3>Contemporary Identity and Recognition</h3>
            <p>Modern Cornwall balances integration into England/UK with maintaining distinct identity. The <strong>Cornish nationalist movement</strong> advocates for recognition ranging from cultural autonomy to independence, though most Cornish support remaining in the UK while seeking greater recognition. The 2014 national minority status represented significant victory. Political party Mebyon Kernow (Sons of Cornwall) advocates for Cornish autonomy similar to Wales or Scotland. Cultural symbols including the <strong>Saint Piran's Flag</strong> (white cross on black field) appear widely throughout Cornwall. Annual Saint Piran's Day celebrations (March 5) demonstrate Cornish identity with parades, language activities, and cultural events. Tourism presents complex dynamics—economically vital but potentially commodifying culture. Second-home ownership and high property prices create local tensions. Organizations including Gorseth Kernow (Cornish Gorsedd), Cornish Language Partnership, and numerous cultural societies work to preserve and promote Cornish culture. The Cornish demonstrate that extinguished cultures can be revived through dedicated effort, though full restoration of historical cultural continuity remains impossible.
