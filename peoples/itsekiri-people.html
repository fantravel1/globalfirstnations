            <h2>Who Are the Itsekiri?</h2>
            <p>The Itsekiri are an ethnic group of the western Niger Delta in Nigeria, centered on Warri and the coastal territories of Delta State. Numbering approximately 800,000-1,000,000, they are smaller than neighboring Urhobo and Ijaw but historically significant as the founders of the Warri Kingdom and as intermediaries in European trade. The Itsekiri speak Itsekiri, a Yoruboid language showing their historical connection to the Yoruba, though their culture reflects centuries of delta adaptation and interaction with coastal peoples. Their traditional ruler, the Olu of Warri, maintains ceremonial importance, and the kingdom's long history of European contact shaped Itsekiri identity as cosmopolitan traders and diplomats.</p>

            <h2>Warri Kingdom</h2>
            <p>The Warri Kingdom, founded by the 15th century, developed as a trading state at the intersection of delta waterways and Atlantic commerce. The ruling dynasty traces descent from a Benin prince who migrated to the coast; subsequent Olus (kings) built a commercial power controlling trade with European ships. Portuguese missionaries converted the royal family to Christianity as early as the 16th century—the Itsekiri were among Africa's earliest Christian communities. Trade items included ivory, pepper, textiles, and enslaved people. The Olu's authority extended over commerce and diplomacy; trading "houses" competed for commercial advantage. British colonial interests clashed with Itsekiri autonomy; the kingdom was eventually incorporated into colonial Nigeria.</p>

            <h2>Trade Intermediaries</h2>
            <p>The Itsekiri excelled as commercial intermediaries between European traders and interior peoples. From Portuguese contacts in the 15th century through British dominance in the 19th, Itsekiri merchants managed the flow of goods between ship and shore. Palm oil became the dominant trade commodity after the abolition of the slave trade; Itsekiri traders controlled much of the palm oil reaching European ships. Competition with Ijaw traders and British firms created conflicts, including armed confrontations. The colonial period diminished Itsekiri commercial dominance as Europeans bypassed African intermediaries. Yet the legacy of commerce shaped Itsekiri culture, emphasizing education, cosmopolitanism, and engagement with wider worlds.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Itsekiri</h2>
            <p>Modern Itsekiri maintain identity as the indigenous people of Warri, though they are now a minority in the city that has grown around the historic kingdom. Competition with Urhobo and Ijaw for resources, positions, and political power in Delta State has generated tensions, sometimes violent. Oil extraction in Itsekiri waters brings both revenues and environmental damage; the Olu and Itsekiri organizations advocate for community interests in petroleum politics. Education has produced Itsekiri professionals and businesspeople active throughout Nigeria. The Itsekiri National Youth Council and other organizations promote ethnic interests. Cultural festivals celebrate Itsekiri heritage, while debates about the Olu's succession and authority continue. The Itsekiri navigate as a small but historically significant group in complex regional and national politics.</p>
