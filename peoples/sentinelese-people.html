            <h2>Who Are the Sentinelese?</h2>
            <p>The Sentinelese are the indigenous inhabitants of North Sentinel Island in the Andaman archipelago, India. Their population is estimated at 50-200 people, though precise numbers are unknown. They speak an unrecorded Andamanese language. The Sentinelese are considered the most isolated people on Earth, having rejected all contact with the outside world and attacked outsiders who approach their island. Their culture, language, and lifeways remain essentially unknown. Like other Andamanese, they likely descend from very early human migrations, with possibly tens of thousands of years of isolated development on their small island.</p>

            <h2>Rejection of Contact</h2>
            <p>The Sentinelese have consistently rejected all contact attempts, often violently. British expeditions in the 19th century were met with arrows. Indian government contact expeditions (1967-1996) sometimes achieved brief, wary interactions when gifts were left on beaches, but the Sentinelese never reciprocated or allowed approach. Helicopters surveying the island after the 2004 tsunami were shot at with arrows. In 2006, two fishermen whose boat drifted ashore were killed. In 2018, American missionary John Allen Chau was killed when he illegally approached the island. The Sentinelese's consistent hostility has effectively protected them from the diseases and disruption that destroyed other Andamanese groups.</p>

            <h2>Legal Protection</h2>
            <p>India has declared North Sentinel Island and its surrounding waters off-limits. Approaching within 3 nautical miles is prohibited under the Protection of Aboriginal Tribes Regulation and other laws. After the 2018 Chau incident, India reaffirmed its non-contact policy. The Indian Coast Guard patrols the exclusion zone. This legal protection, combined with Sentinelese hostility, creates a de facto isolation zone. The policy recognizes that contact would likely be catastrophic—the Sentinelese have no immunity to common diseases and their small population could be devastated by a single epidemic. Their isolation is both self-chosen and legally enforced.</p>

            <h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>
            <p>The Sentinelese raise profound ethical questions. Should isolated peoples be contacted "for their own good"? History shows contacted isolated groups typically suffer population collapse, cultural destruction, and dependence. The Sentinelese have made their preference clear through consistent hostility. Respecting their choice means accepting we may never know their language, culture, or thoughts. Some argue contact is inevitable and should be managed; others (including most anthropologists and indigenous rights organizations) support non-contact. The Sentinelese represent the most extreme case of indigenous peoples' right to refuse engagement with the outside world. Their survival depends on that right being respected.</p>
