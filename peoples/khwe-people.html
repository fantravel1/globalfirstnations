            <h2>Who Are the Khwe?</h2>
            <p>The Khwe (also Kxoe, Kxoé, or Barakwena) are a San (Bushmen) people inhabiting the riverine environments of the Caprivi Strip (now Zambezi Region) in northeastern Namibia, with populations in adjacent Botswana, Angola, and Zambia. Numbering approximately 6,000-8,000, they speak Khwe (Kxoe), a Khoisan language with click consonants, part of the Khoe-Kwadi branch. Unlike desert-dwelling San groups, the Khwe traditionally lived along rivers and floodplains, combining hunting and gathering with fishing. Their military service during South Africa's Bush War (1966-1989) created a complex legacy; many Khwe served as trackers and soldiers, affecting both their post-war situation and relationships with neighboring peoples.</p>

            <h2>River Foragers</h2>
            <p>The Khwe adapted to the riverine environments of the Okavango-Kwando-Zambezi system, distinguishing them from Kalahari Desert San. Rivers and floodplains provided fish, aquatic plants, and game attracted to water. The Khwe combined fishing with hunting (using bows, snares, and later guns) and gathering wild plants. Seasonal movements followed resource availability along rivers. This riparian adaptation shaped Khwe material culture: fishing techniques, canoe use, and settlement patterns near water. The river environment also brought the Khwe into contact with Bantu-speaking agricultural peoples (Lozi, Mbukushu, Yeyi); relationships ranged from exchange to exploitation, with Khwe sometimes serving as semi-attached workers for wealthier neighbors.</p>

            <h2>Bush War Legacy</h2>
            <p>During South Africa's war against Namibian independence (1966-1989), the South African Defence Force recruited San peoples, including Khwe, as trackers and soldiers. San tracking skills made them valuable; military service provided income and status. The 31 Battalion and other units included many Khwe. This military role created complex legacies: some Khwe gained skills and resources; others suffered war's trauma; all were associated with the losing side. After Namibian independence (1990), former soldiers and their families faced uncertain futures. Some were relocated to South Africa (Schmidtsdrift, then Platfontein); others remained in Namibia, sometimes facing discrimination. The military experience disrupted traditional life while creating new community structures.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Khwe</h2>
            <p>Modern Khwe in Namibia primarily live in and around Bwabwata National Park in the Zambezi Region. The park was established on Khwe traditional lands; community relationships with conservation authorities are complicated. Some Khwe work in tourism or conservation; others struggle with poverty and marginalization. The Khwe language is endangered; younger people increasingly speak dominant regional languages. Traditional knowledge faces erosion. In Botswana, Khwe around the Okavango face similar challenges to other San groups. The South African Khwe community at Platfontein maintains a distinct identity shaped by military experience and displacement. Advocacy organizations work to secure Khwe land rights and cultural preservation. The Khwe demonstrate how indigenous peoples' involvement in colonial conflicts creates ongoing consequences.</p>
