            <h2>Who Are the Tokelauan?</h2>
            <p>The Tokelauan are a Polynesian people inhabiting Tokelau, a territory of three coral atolls in the South Pacific administered by New Zealand. The resident population is approximately 1,500, though many more Tokelauans live in New Zealand (around 7,000) and Samoa. They speak Tokelauan, a Polynesian language closely related to Samoan and other Western Polynesian languages. Tokelau is one of the world's smallest and most isolated nations—the total land area is only 12 square kilometers (less than 5 square miles), spread across three atolls with no airport and only ship access. This extreme isolation has helped preserve distinctive communal traditions.</p>

            <h2>Communal Society</h2>
            <p>Tokelauan society is organized around the principle of communal sharing (inati), one of Polynesia's strongest systems of collective resource distribution. Fish catches, for example, are divided equally among all households regardless of who caught them. Each atoll is governed by a council of elders (taupulega) representing extended family groups. Leadership rotates among families, and decisions are made by consensus. Land is held communally by extended families. This egalitarian system developed as an adaptation to atoll living, where resources are limited and variable—sharing ensured survival for all. The church (predominantly Catholic on Nukunonu, Congregational on Atafu and Fakaofo) plays a central role in community life.</p>

            <h2>Atoll Adaptation</h2>
            <p>Life on coral atolls requires specific adaptations. With no high ground, fresh water, or rich soil, Tokelauans traditionally depended on the sea, coconut palms, and breadfruit. Fishing—particularly communal fishing drives where entire villages participate—provides protein. Coconut provides food, drink, oil, and construction materials. Breadfruit and taro (grown in composted pits) supplement the diet. Traditional houses used coral, wood, and thatch. Navigation and canoe-building skills were essential for inter-atoll travel and fishing. Cyclones pose existential threats to these low-lying communities. Climate change and sea level rise represent urgent concerns—Tokelau's highest point is only 5 meters above sea level, making it extremely vulnerable to flooding.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Tokelauan</h2>
            <p>Modern Tokelau faces unique challenges and has made innovative adaptations. In 2012, Tokelau became the first nation to generate 100% of its electricity from solar power. However, dependency on New Zealand aid and remittances from overseas Tokelauans is high. Referendums on self-determination in 2006 and 2007 fell short of the required two-thirds majority for independence. Many Tokelauans have migrated to New Zealand for education and economic opportunities, creating a diaspora larger than the home population. The Tokelauan language remains strong among older generations but faces pressure from English. Traditional customs including the inati system and village governance continue, adapted to modern conditions. Tokelau represents how small Pacific communities maintain identity while facing global challenges.</p>
