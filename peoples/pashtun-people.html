            <h2>Who Are the Pashtuns?</h2>
            <p>The Pashtuns (also Pakhtuns, Pathans) are an Iranian people numbering approximately 50-60 million—the world's largest tribal society. They comprise roughly 40-45% of Afghanistan's population and 15-20% of Pakistan's (concentrated in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and the former FATA). They speak Pashto, an Eastern Iranian language. Pashtuns inhabit the rugged Hindu Kush mountains and adjacent plains, historically dominating Afghanistan politically while straddling the British-drawn Durand Line (1893) dividing them between countries. Their tribal code Pashtunwali governs social life; their history of resistance shapes regional and global politics.</p>

            <h2>Pashtunwali Code</h2>
            <p>Pashtunwali—the Pashtun way—is an ancient code governing social behavior. Core principles include melmastia (hospitality to all guests), nanawatai (asylum to those seeking protection), badal (revenge/justice for wrongs), nang (honor), and ghayrat (courage). These principles operate independent of and sometimes conflict with state law and even Islamic law. Feuds can persist for generations; hospitality extends even to enemies. This code shapes everything from individual conduct to geopolitics—understanding why Pashtuns sheltered bin Laden requires understanding nanawatai. Pashtunwali creates strong group solidarity but complicates modern governance.</p>

            <h2>Warriors and Resistance</h2>
            <p>Pashtuns have resisted every invader: Alexander the Great, Mughals, British Empire (three Anglo-Afghan Wars), Soviet Union, and now the US-led coalition. This warrior tradition is source of immense pride. The British called Pashtun territory the "graveyard of empires." Tribal militias historically defended autonomy against central authority. In modern conflicts, the Taliban emerged primarily (though not exclusively) from Pashtun populations, drawing on Pashtunwali values, grievances against government corruption, and Deobandi Islamic ideology. The movement's leadership remains predominantly Pashtun, complicating ethnic politics in both countries.</p>

            <h2>Divided Homeland</h2>
            <p>The Durand Line, drawn by British India (1893), divided Pashtun tribes between Afghanistan and what became Pakistan. Afghanistan never accepted this border; Pakistan considers it international boundary. This division shapes regional instability—cross-border movement, militant sanctuaries, ethnic irredentism. In Pakistan, Pashtuns faced marginalization; in Afghanistan, they dominated despite minority status in population. The Pakistani Taliban operates primarily in Pashtun regions; military operations displaced millions. Pashtun nationalist movements (historically the ANP, more recently PTM) advocate for rights and challenge state narratives.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Pashtuns</h2>
            <p>Modern Pashtuns navigate war, displacement, and rapid change. Afghanistan's Taliban government is Pashtun-dominated; its rule affects all Afghans but raises ethnic tensions. In Pakistan, Pashtuns seek political voice amid security concerns. Millions are refugees in Pakistan, Iran, and globally. Urban Pashtuns increasingly adopt modern lifestyles while maintaining ethnic pride. Traditional culture—attan dance, landay poetry, distinctive dress—persists alongside globalization. How Pashtuns balance Pashtunwali with modernity, achieve political stability, and heal from decades of war shapes this proud people's future across their divided mountain homeland.</p>
