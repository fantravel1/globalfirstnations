            <h2>Who Are the Maliseet?</h2>
            <p>The Maliseet, who call themselves Wolastoqiyik ("People of the Beautiful River"), are an Algonquian people indigenous to the Saint John River valley in present-day New Brunswick, Canada, and northern Maine, USA. Numbering approximately 8,000-10,000, they live primarily in six First Nations in New Brunswick and the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians in Maine. They speak Maliseet-Passamaquoddy, an Eastern Algonquian language closely related to Passamaquoddy and more distantly to other Abenaki languages. The Maliseet are part of the Wabanaki Confederacy alongside the Mi'kmaq, Passamaquoddy, Penobscot, and Abenaki. The Saint John River (Wolastoq—"the good and beautiful river") is central to Maliseet identity and continues to sustain communities today.</p>

            <h2>River People</h2>
            <p>The Wolastoq (Saint John River) shaped traditional Maliseet life. The river provided salmon, sturgeon, and other fish; its valley supported agriculture (corn, beans, squash) unusual this far north. Birch bark canoes enabled travel throughout the watershed. Seasonal rounds followed resource availability: spring fishing at falls and rapids, summer agriculture and gathering, fall hunting in the interior, winter camps for trapping. The river was a highway connecting communities and enabling trade. Maliseet territory extended from the river's headwaters in Maine through New Brunswick to the Bay of Fundy. This riverine adaptation created a distinctive lifeway, different from the maritime Mi'kmaq and forest-dwelling peoples. The Maliseet developed expertise in canoe building; their birch bark canoes were elegant and swift.</p>

            <h2>Wabanaki Confederacy</h2>
            <p>The Maliseet are members of the Wabanaki ("People of the Dawnland") Confederacy, a political and military alliance of northeastern Algonquian nations. The confederacy coordinated diplomacy, trade, and defense against Haudenosaunee expansion and later English colonization. Wabanaki nations maintained the wampum belt recording their alliance. The confederacy remained powerful through the colonial period; Wabanaki warriors allied with the French against the English in numerous conflicts. After British victory, Wabanaki nations signed treaties—the Maliseet signed the Treaties of 1725-26 with the British, which guaranteed fishing and hunting rights. These treaties remain legally significant today; Canadian courts have affirmed Mi'kmaq and Maliseet treaty rights to fish and hunt. The confederacy has been revived in modern times, with chiefs meeting to address shared concerns.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Maliseet</h2>
            <p>Modern Maliseet communities straddle the US-Canada border, divided by the international boundary that cut through their territory. In Canada, the six Maliseet First Nations (Madawaska, Tobique, Woodstock, Kingsclear, Saint Mary's, Oromocto) address issues including land claims, treaty rights, and cultural preservation. The Tobique First Nation was home to Sandra Lovelace Nicholas, whose case before the UN Human Rights Committee led Canada to amend the Indian Act's discriminatory provisions against women. In Maine, the Houlton Band gained federal recognition in 1980 under the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act. The Maliseet-Passamaquoddy language is severely endangered, with perhaps only a few hundred fluent speakers, mostly elderly. Language revitalization programs exist but face challenges. Economic development, education, and health remain community priorities. The Maliseet, like other Wabanaki peoples, assert their treaty rights and continuing nationhood despite centuries of colonialism.</p>
