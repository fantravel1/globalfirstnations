            <h2>Who Are the Yanomami?</h2>
            <p>The Yanomami are one of the largest relatively isolated indigenous peoples in South America, numbering approximately 35,000—about 21,000 in Brazil and 14,000 in Venezuela. They inhabit the Amazon rainforest along the Brazil-Venezuela border, in a territory larger than Portugal. They speak Yanomami languages (four related languages forming a language isolate). The Yanomami maintained substantial isolation until the mid-20th century; contact brought devastating diseases. Known for their communal houses (shabono), elaborate rituals, and forest knowledge, the Yanomami face ongoing threats from illegal gold mining, deforestation, and government neglect—a humanitarian crisis drawing international attention.</p>

            <h2>Forest People</h2>
            <p>Yanomami have inhabited the Amazon highlands for at least 1,000 years. They practice slash-and-burn agriculture (plantains, cassava), hunting, fishing, and gathering—a sustainable adaptation to rainforest ecology. Villages center on the shabono—a communal circular structure housing 50-400 people under one roof, surrounding an open plaza. Communities are autonomous; warfare and alliances historically characterized inter-village relations. Spiritual life involves shamans (shapori) who communicate with spirits through yãkoana (hallucinogenic snuff). The reahu festival honors deceased through mortuary ritual. This way of life depends entirely on intact forest.</p>

            <h2>Contact and Crisis</h2>
            <p>Sustained outside contact began in the 1950s-60s with missionaries and government posts. Diseases to which Yanomami had no immunity caused epidemics killing thousands. The 1970s-80s gold rush brought 40,000 miners (garimpeiros) into Yanomami territory—violence, mercury poisoning, malaria, and social disruption devastated communities. International pressure led to demarcation of Yanomami territory (Brazil, 1992)—9.6 million hectares. But enforcement has been inconsistent. Davi Kopenawa emerged as Yanomami spokesperson, advocating internationally for his people's rights and rainforest protection.</p>

            <h2>Ongoing Threats</h2>
            <p>The 21st century brought renewed crisis. Illegal gold mining surged under Brazil's Bolsonaro government (2019-2022), with estimated 20,000 miners invading Yanomami lands. The humanitarian catastrophe included malnutrition among children, malaria outbreaks, mercury contamination, and violence. In 2023, Brazil's new government declared emergency, launching military operations against miners and aid missions. Venezuela's Yanomami face similar threats with less attention. The Yanomami struggle represents broader Amazon crisis—indigenous peoples defending forest against extraction that threatens both their survival and global climate.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Yanomami</h2>
            <p>Modern Yanomami navigate between traditional life and outside pressures. Many communities maintain largely traditional ways; others have more contact with Brazilian/Venezuelan society. Health care, education, and economic needs create dependencies on external systems. Yanomami activists like Davi Kopenawa and organizations like Hutukara advocate for rights and environmental protection. Some Yanomami have adopted aspects of outside culture while maintaining identity. How the Yanomami survive mining invasion, disease, and climate change—whether their forest home remains intact—tests both indigenous resilience and international commitment to indigenous and environmental protection.</p>
