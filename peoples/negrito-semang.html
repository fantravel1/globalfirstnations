            <h2>Who Are the Semang?</h2>
            <p>The Semang are a collective term for several Negrito ethnic groups indigenous to the rainforests of the northern Malay Peninsula, primarily in Malaysia and southern Thailand. Numbering approximately 5,000, they include groups such as the Batek, Jahai, Kensiu, Lanoh, and Menriq. They are among the oldest inhabitants of Southeast Asia, with genetic studies suggesting their ancestors arrived over 50,000 years ago.</p>
            <p>Physically distinctive with dark skin, curly hair, and short stature, the Semang represent an ancient population layer predating later Austronesian and Austroasiatic migrations. Their traditional nomadic lifestyle, egalitarian social organization, and sophisticated forest knowledge offer insights into human adaptation to tropical rainforests over deep time.</p>

            <h2>Nomadic Forest Life</h2>
            <p>Traditional Semang life was fully nomadic, with small bands moving through the forest following seasonal availability of food resources. They built temporary lean-to shelters from leaves and branches, abandoning them as they moved. Camps might be occupied for days or weeks before relocation.</p>
            <p>Hunting with blowpipes and poisoned darts provided protein from monkeys, squirrels, and birds. Gathering was equally important—wild yams, fruits, nuts, honey, and countless other forest products. This lifestyle required encyclopedic knowledge of forest ecology, plant properties, and animal behavior passed down through generations.</p>

            <h2>Egalitarian Society</h2>
            <p>Semang society is remarkably egalitarian. No formal leadership exists; decisions are made through group consensus. Food is shared according to strict rules—a successful hunter does not keep his kill but distributes it among the band. Accumulation of property is discouraged; generosity and sharing are paramount values.</p>
            <p>Gender relations are relatively equal compared to many societies. Women contribute substantially to subsistence through gathering and participate in decision-making. Marriage is flexible, with couples separating and reuniting with little formality. Children are raised communally with great affection and minimal discipline.</p>

            <h2>Spiritual World</h2>
            <p>Traditional Semang religion involves a rich spirit world inhabiting the forest. Cenoi are benevolent spirits associated with flowers; other spirits dwell in trees, rivers, and mountains. Thunderstorms are particularly significant—thunder represents an angry deity requiring appeasement through blood offerings (traditionally obtained by cutting the shin).</p>
            <p>Shamans (hala) enter trance states to communicate with spirits, diagnose illness, and predict the future. Dreams are considered important communications from the spirit world. These beliefs are intimately connected to the forest environment—losing the forest means losing the spiritual world that gives life meaning.</p>

            <h2>Deforestation Threat</h2>
            <p>The Semang face an existential threat from deforestation. Malaysia has cleared vast areas of rainforest for palm oil plantations, logging, and development. The forests that sustained Semang life for millennia are disappearing rapidly. Without forests, nomadic hunting and gathering becomes impossible.</p>
            <p>Many Semang have been resettled into permanent villages by government programs that view nomadism as backward. These resettlements often fail—without forests to exploit, communities become dependent on cash economies they are poorly prepared for. Health problems, alcoholism, and cultural disintegration follow. Some groups, like the Batek, continue to resist sedentarization and advocate for forest rights.</p>
