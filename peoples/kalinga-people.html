            <h2>Who Are the Kalinga?</h2>
            <p>The Kalinga are an indigenous people of the northern Cordillera mountains in Luzon, Philippines, numbering approximately 120,000-150,000. They speak several Kalinga languages, part of the Cordilleran branch of Austronesian. The Kalinga are renowned as fierce warriors who historically practiced headhunting; their warrior tradition and elaborate tattooing practices distinguish them from neighboring Cordilleran peoples. They inhabit the Kalinga province, named after them, along the Chico River and its tributaries. The Kalinga successfully resisted both Spanish and American colonization.</p>

            <h2>Warrior Culture and Bodong</h2>
            <p>The Kalinga developed sophisticated institutions to manage their warrior culture. The bodong (peace pact) system created formal agreements between villages regulating conflict, trade, and mutual obligations. Bodong holders (pact keepers) negotiated disputes and maintained inter-village relationships. This indigenous legal system allowed warfare to coexist with regional stability—villages not in conflict maintained peaceful relations through bodong ties. The system demonstrates that "stateless" societies developed complex governance mechanisms. Bodong remains practiced today, adapted to modern disputes over land and resources.</p>

            <h2>Whang-Od and Traditional Tattooing</h2>
            <p>Kalinga traditional tattooing (batok) achieved international recognition through Whang-Od (Apo Whang-Od), born around 1917, considered the last mambabatok (traditional tattoo artist) practicing the ancient hand-tap method. Her tattoos mark warriors' achievements and women's status. Media attention transformed Whang-Od into a celebrity, drawing tourists to remote Buscalan village. This attention raised questions about cultural commodification, informed consent (given Whang-Od's advanced age), and the transformation of sacred practice into tourism. Whang-Od has trained younger tattoo artists, potentially preserving the tradition.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Kalinga</h2>
            <p>Modern Kalinga balance traditional practices with Philippine mainstream society. The Chico River Dam struggle (1970s-1980s) united Kalinga and other Cordilleran peoples against government dam projects that would have flooded their lands—a successful resistance led by Macli-ing Dulag, who was assassinated for his activism. This struggle continues against ongoing dam and mining proposals. Rice terrace agriculture persists alongside education and migration. Kalinga politicians serve in provincial and national government. How the Kalinga preserve warrior heritage and bodong institutions while engaging with modern development shapes this mountain people's ongoing adaptation.</p>
