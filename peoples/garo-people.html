            <h2>Who Are the Garo?</h2>
            <p>The Garo (A'chik) are a Tibeto-Burman indigenous people primarily inhabiting the Garo Hills of Meghalaya, India, with populations also in Bangladesh. They number approximately 1.2-1.5 million across both countries. The Garo speak A'chik (Garo), a Tibeto-Burman language with several dialects. The Garo are one of the few remaining matrilineal societies in the world, where property and clan membership pass through the female line. Along with the Khasi and Jaintia, they constitute Meghalaya's main tribal populations. The Garo are known for their Wangala (100 Drums) festival and their traditional bachelor dormitories (nokpante).</p>

            <h2>Matrilineal Society</h2>
            <p>Garo society is matrilineal—children belong to their mother's clan, inherit through the mother, and the youngest daughter (nokna) inherits the family property and responsibility for parents. After marriage, husbands move to their wife's household. However, unlike matriarchy, men still hold many public leadership positions. The system creates unique dynamics: women control property but men often dominate village councils. The nokna system ensures elderly care while maintaining property within the matriline. While modernization and Christianity have modified some practices, matrilineal descent remains fundamental to Garo identity and distinguishes them from surrounding patrilineal societies.</p>

            <h2>Wangala Festival</h2>
            <p>Wangala, often called the "100 Drums Festival," is the most important Garo celebration, marking the end of the agricultural season in November and honoring Misi Saljong, the deity of fertility and crops. The festival features mass drumming and dancing, with hundreds of drummers playing traditional dama drums in synchronized rhythms. Dancers wear traditional hornbill feather headdresses and colorful garments. The festival includes feasting on rice beer and pork dishes. Wangala reinforces community bonds, celebrates the harvest, and showcases Garo musical traditions. It has become a tourist attraction while maintaining its significance for Garo communities.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Garo</h2>
            <p>Modern Garo are predominantly Christian, with conversion beginning under British rule. Christianity has modified but not eliminated traditional practices—many Garo celebrate both Christmas and Wangala. Education levels have risen significantly, producing Garo professionals in various fields. The Garo Hills face environmental challenges including deforestation and unsustainable mining. Cross-border Garo in Bangladesh maintain cultural connections with Indian Garo. Political activism around tribal autonomy and environmental protection continues. The A'chik language faces pressure from English and regional languages. How the Garo maintain their distinctive matrilineal identity, balance traditional and Christian practices, and protect their hill environment shapes their future in Northeast India.</p>
