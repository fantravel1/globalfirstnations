            <h2>Who Are the Kelabit?</h2>
            <p>The Kelabit are an indigenous Dayak people of the Kelabit Highlands, a remote plateau at approximately 1,000 meters elevation in the interior of Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo. Numbering approximately 6,000-7,000, they are one of Sarawak's smallest ethnic groups. They speak Kelabit, an Austronesian language in the Apad-Kelabit family. The Kelabit are distinctive for their high-altitude wet rice cultivation in a region where most interior peoples practiced shifting cultivation, and for their remarkable adoption of Christianity and education, resulting in one of Borneo's highest-educated indigenous communities despite their remote location.</p>

            <h2>Highland Agriculture</h2>
            <p>The Kelabit Highlands' elevation creates cooler temperatures unusual in equatorial Borneo, enabling wet rice cultivation that would be impossible in the humid lowlands. The Kelabit developed sophisticated irrigation systems for rice paddies, producing surplus rice that made them relatively prosperous. Traditional villages were centered on longhouses—large communal structures housing multiple families. Rice cultivation structured social and ritual life; the annual cycle of planting and harvest determined community rhythms. Buffalo were raised for plowing and as wealth for feasts. This agricultural adaptation to a challenging environment produced a stable, self-sufficient society before modern changes transformed highland life.</p>

            <h2>Christianity and Education</h2>
            <p>The Kelabit converted almost entirely to Christianity following contact with missionaries (primarily the Borneo Evangelical Mission) beginning in the 1940s. Tom Harrisson, a British anthropologist parachuted into the highlands during World War II to organize resistance against Japanese occupation, documented traditional culture just before major changes. Christianity replaced traditional animist practices; longhouse living eventually gave way to nuclear family houses. Most remarkably, the Kelabit embraced education with extraordinary enthusiasm. Despite remote location, Kelabit families sent children to distant schools; the community now includes numerous university graduates, professionals, and academics—educational achievement far exceeding their small population and geographic isolation.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Kelabit</h2>
            <p>Modern Kelabit face the paradox of success: education drew people out of the highlands, depopulating villages while producing a dispersed professional diaspora. Bario, the main Kelabit settlement, has developed ecotourism around highland culture, landscapes, and organic rice. The annual Bario Food Festival celebrates local products. However, most Kelabit now live in towns and cities; highland villages are home primarily to elderly. The Kelabit language faces transmission challenges as urban Kelabit speak Malay or English. Cultural organizations work to maintain heritage; annual homecomings bring diaspora members back. The Kelabit represent how small indigenous groups can achieve remarkable educational and economic success while confronting questions about what remains when most community members leave the ancestral homeland.</p>
