            <h2>Who Are the Kalenjin?</h2>
            <p>The Kalenjin are a Nilotic ethnic group of Kenya's western highlands and Rift Valley, numbering approximately 6-7 million people. "Kalenjin" is an umbrella term uniting several sub-groups—Nandi, Kipsigis, Keiyo, Marakwet, Tugen, Sabaot, Pokot, and Terik—who speak closely related languages of the Southern Nilotic branch. The Kalenjin identity emerged in the 1940s-50s as these groups united politically. The Kalenjin are globally famous for producing a disproportionate number of elite distance runners—Kalenjin athletes have dominated middle and long-distance running at Olympics and world championships, winning more medals than any other ethnic group of comparable size.</p>

            <h2>Running Dominance</h2>
            <p>Since Kipchoge Keino's breakthrough at the 1968 Olympics, Kalenjin runners have dominated distance running. Athletes like Eliud Kipchoge (marathon world record holder and only person to run a sub-2-hour marathon), David Rudisha (800m world record), and dozens of world and Olympic champions have emerged from the community. Explanations for this dominance include: high-altitude training (2000-2500m), running culture from childhood (running to school), economic motivation (prize money transforms lives), lean physique with efficient running economy, and perhaps genetic factors (though this remains debated). The Iten region has become a global training destination, and running success has transformed Kalenjin communities economically.</p>

            <h2>Age-Set System</h2>
            <p>Traditional Kalenjin society was organized around age-sets (ipinda)—groups of males initiated together who progress through life stages collectively. Initiation (tumdo) involved circumcision and seclusion, teaching cultural values and creating lifelong bonds among age-mates. Different age-sets held different social roles: warriors, elders, etc. The system provided governance, conflict resolution, and social organization without centralized authority. Though modified by modernity, age-set identity remains meaningful, and initiation (now often in medical settings) continues as a marker of Kalenjin manhood. The collective identity fostered by age-sets may contribute to Kalenjin group solidarity and running culture's peer encouragement.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Kalenjin</h2>
            <p>Modern Kalenjin are influential in Kenyan politics—Daniel arap Moi, Kenya's second president, ruled for 24 years, and William Ruto became president in 2022. This political prominence, combined with ethnic competition, has involved Kalenjin in electoral violence, particularly in 2007-2008. Running success has transformed many communities, with prize money funding schools, clinics, and businesses. Agriculture, particularly tea and dairy farming in the highlands, remains important. Christianity is dominant, with active church participation. The Kalenjin identity, though constructed relatively recently, has become meaningful, uniting the sub-groups. Challenges include managing inter-ethnic relations and translating running success into broader development.</p>
