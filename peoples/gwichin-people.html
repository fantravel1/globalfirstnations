            <h2>Who Are the Gwich'in?</h2>
            <p>The Gwich'in are an Athabascan (Dene) people inhabiting the subarctic regions of northeastern Alaska and northwestern Canada (Yukon and Northwest Territories). Numbering approximately 9,000 people, they speak Gwich'in, a Northern Athabascan language. Their name means "people of the caribou," reflecting their profound cultural and spiritual connection to the Porcupine caribou herd, which migrates through their traditional territory. The Gwich'in have inhabited this region for at least 20,000 years, developing a sophisticated hunting culture centered on caribou that continues to define their identity and sustain their communities today.</p>

            <h2>Caribou Culture</h2>
            <p>The Gwich'in relationship with caribou transcends simple subsistence—it is spiritual, defining their identity as a people. Oral traditions speak of a time when Gwich'in and caribou were one, and a piece of each remains in the other. The Porcupine caribou herd, numbering approximately 200,000 animals, migrates between coastal calving grounds in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and winter range in the interior. Traditional hunting practices involve intercepting the migration at river crossings and mountain passes. Every part of the caribou is used—meat for food, hides for clothing and shelter, bones and antlers for tools. Caribou remain the foundation of Gwich'in diet, culture, and spiritual life, and protecting the caribou and their calving grounds is inseparable from protecting Gwich'in culture.</p>

            <h2>Arctic National Wildlife Refuge</h2>
            <p>The Gwich'in have become internationally recognized advocates for protecting the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, where the Porcupine caribou herd calves each spring. This area, called "Iizhik Gwats'an Gwandaii Goodlit" (The Sacred Place Where Life Begins), is proposed for oil and gas development. Since 1988, when Gwich'in from Alaska and Canada gathered to oppose drilling, they have been prominent voices in this environmental debate. The Gwich'in Steering Committee represents their position that drilling would devastate the caribou upon which their culture depends. This advocacy represents indigenous peoples defending traditional lands against extractive industries, placing subsistence rights and cultural survival against energy development.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Gwich'in</h2>
            <p>Modern Gwich'in communities—including Arctic Village, Venetie, Fort Yukon in Alaska, and Old Crow, Fort McPherson in Canada—balance traditional subsistence practices with contemporary life. Caribou hunting remains central, though snowmobiles have replaced dog teams and rifles replaced traditional weapons. The Gwich'in language is endangered but language programs in schools work toward revitalization. Many Gwich'in have achieved success in education, politics, and professions while maintaining cultural connections. The cross-border nature of the Porcupine caribou herd means Gwich'in advocacy requires international cooperation. Climate change affects caribou behavior and availability, adding another challenge. The Gwich'in demonstrate how indigenous peoples can maintain traditional relationships with the land while engaging politically to protect that relationship.</p>
