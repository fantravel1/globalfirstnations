            <h2>Who Are the Griqua?</h2>
            <p>The Griqua are a South African people of mixed ancestry, descending from unions between Khoikhoi, San, European settlers, and enslaved people at the Cape Colony during the 17th-19th centuries. Numbering approximately 280,000-350,000 (depending on how identity is defined), the Griqua emerged as a distinct group on the Cape frontier, developing their own cultural identity, leadership structures, and eventually independent territories. They speak Afrikaans (which developed partly from Khoi-Dutch contact languages) and historically spoke Cape Khoi dialects. The Griqua established two notable states—Griqualand West and Griqualand East—before being absorbed into the Cape Colony and later South Africa. Today, Griqua identity is experiencing revival.</p>

            <h2>Frontier Origins</h2>
            <p>The Griqua emerged from the social mixing of the Cape Colony frontier. Khoikhoi pastoralists, displaced from their lands, merged with freed slaves, deserters, mixed-race individuals, and others who fell outside colonial society. By the early 19th century, groups led by charismatic leaders (kapteins) had formed cohesive communities. Adam Kok and the Waterboer family led major Griqua groups. The Griqua adopted Christianity, horses, guns, and elements of European dress while maintaining Khoikhoi pastoral traditions. They moved beyond the colonial boundary, establishing independent territories in what became Griqualand West (around Kimberley) and later Griqualand East (around Kokstad). The Griqua states demonstrated that "mixed" peoples could form coherent political entities.</p>

            <h2>Dispossession</h2>
            <p>The discovery of diamonds at Kimberley (1867) sealed Griqualand West's fate. British annexation (1871) stripped the Griqua of their territory. Promises of land and compensation went largely unfulfilled. The Griqua of Griqualand East fared somewhat better initially, maintaining land into the 20th century, but apartheid policies ultimately dispossessed most Griqua. Under apartheid, the Griqua were classified as "Coloured," denying their distinct identity. Griqua lands were taken for white settlement or "Bantustan" development. The proud independent people were reduced to laborers on their former lands. Apartheid's racial categorization obscured the Griqua's indigenous Khoikhoi heritage, leaving them in a complex identity position.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Griqua</h2>
            <p>Post-apartheid South Africa has witnessed Griqua cultural revival. Griqua organizations advocate for recognition as indigenous people (First Nation) with claims to ancestral lands. Legal cases have been brought seeking land restoration and recognition. The Griqua have lodged claims under the Restitution of Land Rights Act. Cultural practices, including the calling (roeping) ceremony to honor ancestors, have been revived. Griqua identity is increasingly asserted by those previously labeled merely "Coloured." However, claims for First Nation status are contested; the relationship between Griqua identity and Khoikhoi heritage is debated. Some Griqua emphasize indigenous roots; others acknowledge complex mixed ancestry. The Griqua demonstrate how colonial-era populations of mixed origin can maintain and revive distinct identities while navigating complex political and legal landscapes.</p>
