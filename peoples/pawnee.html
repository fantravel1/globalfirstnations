            <h2>Who Are the Pawnee?</h2>
            <p>The Pawnee (Chaticks si Chaticks, "Men of Men") are a Caddoan-speaking people of the Central Plains, originally inhabiting vast territories in present-day Nebraska and Kansas. Today numbering approximately 3,200 enrolled members in the **Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma**, they are renowned for their sophisticated astronomical knowledge, earth lodge villages, and the tragic history of population collapse from over 20,000 to fewer than 700 in a century. The Pawnee were semi-sedentary agriculturalists who combined farming with seasonal buffalo hunts, developed complex star-based religion and ceremonies, and served as US Army scouts against their Lakota enemies—a choice that protected them from military campaigns but couldn't prevent disease and forced removal from devastating their nation.</p>

            <h2>Star Knowledge and Religion</h2>
            <p>The Pawnee developed perhaps the most sophisticated astronomical knowledge of any North American people. Their religion centered on the stars: **Tirawa** (the Creator) placed the stars in the sky as divine powers governing earthly life. The **Morning Star** and **Evening Star** were among the most important deities; their cosmic union created humanity. The Pawnee aligned their earth lodges with astronomical orientations, timed ceremonies to celestial events, and interpreted the night sky as a map of the divine realm. Each village possessed sacred bundles given by the stars, containing objects of power and instructions for ceremonies. The controversial **Morning Star Ceremony** (abandoned by the 1830s) involved sacrifice to ensure cosmic renewal—shocking to Euro-Americans but reflecting the profound connection between Pawnee life and celestial order. This astronomical sophistication amazed early ethnologists; the Pawnee star map, recording constellations on buckskin, demonstrates knowledge comparable to ancient Mediterranean civilizations.</p>

            <h2>Earth Lodge Villages and Life</h2>
            <p>Unlike nomadic Plains peoples, the Pawnee lived in permanent earth lodge villages along the Loup and Platte rivers in Nebraska. **Earth lodges**—large dome-shaped structures of timber frames covered with earth—housed extended families of 30-50 people. Women owned the lodges and controlled agriculture; they cultivated corn, beans, squash, and sunflowers in fields around the villages. The Pawnee organized into four bands—Chaui (Grand), Kitkehahki (Republican), Pitahawirata (Tappage), and Skidi (Wolf)—each with autonomous villages united by language, kinship, and ceremony. Twice yearly, the entire nation left the villages for communal buffalo hunts, traveling west to the hunting grounds. This dual economy—farming and hunting—created prosperity and population density unusual on the Plains. The Pawnee faced constant raiding from Lakota and other nomadic peoples who resented their villages' wealth and their alliance with American traders and military.</p>

            <h2>Scouts, Disease, and Removal</h2>
            <p>The Pawnee made a fateful choice to ally with the United States against their Lakota and Cheyenne enemies, providing scouts for the US Army throughout the Indian Wars. The **Pawnee Scouts**, led by Major Frank North, served with distinction, their tracking skills and Plains knowledge invaluable to military campaigns. This alliance couldn't prevent catastrophe: epidemic diseases—smallpox, cholera, measles—reduced the Pawnee from over 20,000 in 1800 to fewer than 3,000 by 1860. Lakota raiders attacked weakened villages; in 1873, over 150 Pawnee were killed by Lakota at Massacre Canyon during a buffalo hunt. Desperate and decimated, the Pawnee agreed to removal to Indian Territory (Oklahoma) in 1875. By 1900, only 700 Pawnee survived—a 96% population collapse within a century. Their Nebraska homeland became farms and ranches; Pawnee scouts who had fought for America received no homeland in return.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Pawnee Nation</h2>
            <p>The **Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma**, headquartered in Pawnee, Oklahoma, has slowly rebuilt from near-extinction. Today approximately 3,200 enrolled members maintain tribal governance, operate a casino and various enterprises, and work to preserve cultural heritage. The Pawnee language is critically endangered—perhaps 10 fluent first-language speakers remain—making language documentation and revitalization urgent priorities. The tribe operates cultural programs, publishes educational materials, and maintains the annual **Pawnee Indian Veterans' Homecoming** honoring the military service tradition extending from the Scouts through world wars to present. The tribe successfully repatriated hundreds of ancestral remains and sacred objects under NAGPRA, including human remains that had been displayed in museums for decades. The Pawnee maintain ceremonies, songs, and dances adapted to contemporary life, demonstrating remarkable resilience in rebuilding a nation that genocide nearly destroyed. The 2023 film <em>Killers of the Flower Moon</em> features Pawnee actor Yancey Red Corn, showing contemporary Pawnee visibility in American culture.</p>
