            <h2>Who Are the Hopi?</h2>
            <p>The Hopi (Hopituh Shi-nu-mu, "The Peaceful People") are a Pueblo people of northeastern Arizona, numbering approximately 18,000 enrolled members. They speak Hopi, a Uto-Aztecan language unrelated to other Pueblo languages. The Hopi villages on the three mesas of northern Arizona include Oraibi—continuously inhabited since at least 1100 CE, making it the oldest continuously occupied settlement in North America. The Hopi have maintained their ancient way of life with remarkable tenacity, preserving complex ceremonial calendar, dry-farming agriculture, and spiritual traditions despite centuries of outside pressure.</p>

            <h2>Ancient Traditions</h2>
            <p>Hopi trace their origins through migrations from previous worlds, emerging into this Fourth World through the sipapu (earth navel). Archaeological and oral evidence confirms continuous occupation of the mesas for over 1,000 years—descendants of Ancestral Puebloans. Hopi developed sophisticated dry-farming in an arid environment where rainfall averages 10 inches annually. Corn is sacred; the Hopi are "People of the Corn." Clan membership, determined matrilineally, governs social organization, ceremonial responsibility, and land rights. Each clan preserves specific ceremonies, songs, and knowledge. This intricate system maintains balance (qua'somi) between humans, nature, and spirit world.</p>

            <h2>Ceremonial Life</h2>
            <p>Hopi religion centers on maintaining cosmic balance through ceremony. The kachinas (katsinam)—spiritual beings who live on the San Francisco Peaks—visit the villages during half the year, represented by masked dancers. Children receive carved kachina dolls as religious instruction. Major ceremonies—Soyal, Powamu, Niman—mark the ceremonial calendar. Ceremonies occur in underground kivas and village plazas. Much of Hopi religion is secret; outsider presence at ceremonies has been increasingly restricted. This spiritual life—tied to agricultural cycle and cosmic order—has continued unbroken for centuries, resisting missionary suppression and modern disruption.</p>

            <h2>Resistance and Conflict</h2>
            <p>Hopi participated in the 1680 Pueblo Revolt, destroying mission at Awatovi. When that village allowed missionaries' return (1700), other Hopi destroyed it entirely—a reminder of Hopi determination to maintain their way. American colonization brought schools, missionaries, and land conflict. The Hopi Reservation, surrounded entirely by the much larger Navajo Reservation, has been subject of bitter land disputes. Internal divisions between "traditionals" and "progressives" created conflict; some villages split. The Hopi rejected the Indian Reorganization Act's tribal council model, though one was eventually imposed. Water rights remain critical in the arid landscape.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Hopi</h2>
            <p>Modern Hopi balance tradition and change on their isolated mesas. Traditional villages maintain ceremonial calendars; modern amenities have reached most areas. Coal mining (Peabody Energy at Black Mesa) provided revenue but environmental and cultural costs led to its closure (2019). Water rights conflicts with Navajo continue. Language remains relatively strong but faces pressure. Tourism and arts (kachina carving, pottery, silverwork) provide income; some ceremonies remain open to respectful visitors while others are strictly closed. The Hopi prophecies—predicting modern developments—attract New Age interest, sometimes unwelcome. How Hopi maintain their peaceful way, protect sacred practices, and survive in their desert homeland continues their ancient covenant.</p>
