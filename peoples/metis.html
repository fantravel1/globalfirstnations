            <h2>Who Are the Métis?</h2>
            <p>The Métis are one of Canada's three recognized Indigenous peoples (alongside First Nations and Inuit), numbering approximately **600,000 self-identified members**—though definitions of Métis identity are contested. Descended from unions between French-Canadian and Scottish fur traders and Cree, Ojibwe, and other First Nations women during the 18th-19th centuries, the Métis developed a distinct culture, language (**Michif**), and national identity centered on the Red River Settlement (present-day Manitoba). They famously resisted Canadian annexation under **Louis Riel** in 1869-70 and 1885, seeking recognition of their land rights and self-government. The Métis flag—a white infinity symbol on blue—represents the joining of two cultures into a people that will exist forever.</p>

            <h2>The Fur Trade Origins</h2>
            <p>The Métis emerged from the North American fur trade. French-Canadian **voyageurs** and Scottish **Nor'Westers** of the Hudson's Bay and North West Companies married Indigenous women according to **"the custom of the country"**—partnerships that provided traders with kinship networks, cultural knowledge, and essential skills for survival. Their children grew up bilingual and bicultural, fluent in both European and Indigenous worlds. By the early 19th century, around the Red River Settlement (Winnipeg area) and throughout the Great Lakes and Western Canada, Métis communities had developed distinctive identities. They became the provisioners of the fur trade, supplying **pemmican** (preserved buffalo meat) that fueled brigades. The **buffalo hunt**—organized with military precision, governed by strict rules, and spanning hundreds of miles—defined Métis life on the prairies. This was not simple mixed ancestry but the emergence of a new people with their own culture, economy, and political consciousness.</p>

            <h2>Louis Riel and Resistance</h2>
            <p>**Louis Riel** (1844-1885) remains the central figure in Métis history—celebrated as a father of Manitoba, condemned as a traitor, and recognized as a visionary who foresaw Indigenous rights struggles. When Canada purchased Rupert's Land from the Hudson's Bay Company in 1869 without consulting residents, the Métis of Red River organized a provisional government under Riel to negotiate entry into Confederation. The **Red River Resistance** succeeded in creating Manitoba (1870) with promised protections for Métis land and language—promises largely broken afterward. When land-hungry settlers and government surveyors threatened Métis communities in Saskatchewan, Riel returned in 1884 to lead the **Northwest Rebellion** (1885). Defeated at Batoche, Riel was tried for treason and hanged—his execution inflaming French-English tensions and creating a martyr. Today, Riel is recognized as a founder of Manitoba; his execution day (November 16) is commemorated as Louis Riel Day.</p>

            <h2>Dispossession and Survival</h2>
            <p>Following 1885, the Métis experienced systematic dispossession. The **scrip** system—certificates exchangeable for land or money—was designed to extinguish Métis claims; speculators and government manipulation ensured most Métis received little lasting benefit. Many fled westward or northward, living on **road allowances** (public lands at road edges) as a landless, marginalized people. Unlike First Nations with treaty rights and reserves, the Métis had no recognized land base, no legal status, and few protections. The 2003 **Powley decision** by the Supreme Court of Canada recognized Métis hunting rights, affirming their constitutional status as Aboriginal peoples with rights under Section 35. This landmark ruling enabled subsequent legal and political advances, though challenges remain—particularly disputes over who qualifies as Métis, with eastern "métis" organizations claiming identity that historic Métis communities reject.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Métis Nation</h2>
            <p>The **Métis National Council** and provincial organizations like the Métis Nation of Alberta represent Métis politically, negotiating with governments on rights and self-governance. The 2016 **Daniels decision** confirmed federal responsibility for Métis, enabling negotiations on services, land, and recognition. Culturally, the Métis have distinctive traditions: **Michif** (a mixed Cree-French language with approximately 1,000 speakers remaining), fiddle music and **jigging** (a distinctive dance style), beadwork featuring the **Métis flower** pattern, and the **sash** (ceinture fléchée) worn as a symbol of identity. Louis Riel Day is now a statutory holiday in Manitoba. Yet controversies persist: who is authentically Métis? How do Métis rights relate to First Nations rights? What obligations do governments owe? The Métis continue asserting nationhood—not as mixed-race individuals but as a distinct Indigenous people with their own history, culture, and rights.</p>
