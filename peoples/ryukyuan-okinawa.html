            <h2>Who Are the Ryukyuan People?</h2>
            <p>The Ryukyuan peoples are the indigenous inhabitants of the Ryukyu Islands, a chain stretching from southern Kyushu to Taiwan, now Okinawa Prefecture and surrounding areas. Approximately 1.4 million people live in these islands, with distinct subgroups including Okinawans, Amami, Miyako, Yaeyama, and Yonaguni peoples. From 1429-1879, an independent Ryukyu Kingdom flourished as a maritime trading power. Japanese annexation in 1879, devastating World War II battles, 27 years of US occupation (1945-1972), and continued heavy US military presence have shaped modern Ryukyuan identity and politics.</p>

            <h2>The Ryukyu Kingdom</h2>
            <p>The Ryukyu Kingdom (1429-1879) was a sophisticated maritime trading state, strategically positioned between Japan, China, Korea, and Southeast Asia. Paying tribute to China while maintaining relations with Japan's Satsuma domain after 1609, Ryukyu navigated complex regional politics. The royal court at Shuri Castle developed distinctive architecture, arts, and bureaucracy blending Chinese and indigenous elements. Classical dance, textile arts (especially bingata dyeing), and music flourished under royal patronage. The kingdom's peaceful commercial character is often contrasted with militaristic Japan.</p>

            <h2>Ryukyuan Languages</h2>
            <p>The Ryukyuan languages—six distinct tongues, not dialects of Japanese—constitute their own branch of the Japonic language family, having diverged over 2,000 years ago. UNESCO classifies all as endangered. Okinawan (Uchinaaguchi) has the most speakers but transmission to children has nearly ceased. Smaller languages like Yaeyama and Yonaguni are critically endangered. Japanese standardization policies suppressed Ryukyuan languages for over a century; speaking them at school brought punishment. Revival efforts face challenges of dialect diversity, lack of standardization, and generations of language shift.</p>

            <h2>Battle of Okinawa</h2>
            <p>The 1945 Battle of Okinawa was one of World War II's bloodiest—approximately 200,000 dead including 94,000 Okinawan civilians, nearly one-quarter of the population. Mass civilian suicides occurred, sometimes coerced by Japanese military. This trauma profoundly shapes Ryukyuan memory and antimilitarism. Controversy over Japanese textbook depictions of wartime events and civilian suicides remain politically charged. The battle's devastation explains Okinawan resentment at bearing Japan's heaviest US military burden—70% of American military facilities in Japan occupy just 0.6% of Japan's land.</p>

            <h2>US Bases and Protest</h2>
            <p>US military bases occupy 15% of Okinawa's main island, creating constant friction: noise, accidents, environmental damage, and crimes by military personnel. Protests against bases have erupted repeatedly, particularly after incidents like the 1995 rape of a schoolgirl by US servicemen. Despite overwhelming local opposition, Tokyo has approved new base construction at Henoko despite Okinawan referendum rejecting it. This conflict embodies Ryukyuan grievances: their homeland treated as sacrificial territory for Japanese-US security arrangements, with local democratic will overridden by national government.</p>
