            <h2>Who Are the Ryukyuan?</h2>
            <p>The Ryukyuan people are the indigenous inhabitants of the Ryukyu Islands (modern Okinawa Prefecture and surrounding islands), numbering approximately 1.4 million. They speak Ryukyuan languages—a branch of the Japonic family distinct from (not dialects of) Japanese—though most now speak Japanese. The Ryukyuans created the Ryukyu Kingdom (1429-1879), an independent state that traded throughout East and Southeast Asia. Japanese annexation (1879), World War II's devastating Battle of Okinawa (1945), and subsequent US military occupation have shaped modern Ryukyuan experience. Today, Okinawans balance Japanese citizenship with distinct cultural identity and ongoing military base controversies.</p>

            <h2>Ryukyu Kingdom</h2>
            <p>The Ryukyu Kingdom (1429-1879), centered on Okinawa, was an independent maritime trading state. Shuri Castle (destroyed in WWII, rebuilt, burned again 2019, being restored) was the royal palace. The kingdom paid tribute to both China and Japan's Satsuma domain—a delicate diplomatic balancing act. Ryukyuan traders connected Japan, China, Korea, and Southeast Asia. Distinctive culture developed: traditional religion (worship of ancestors and kami, female priestesses called noro), Okinawan classical music and dance, karate (originally "te"), and unique cuisine. This independent history grounds Okinawan identity distinct from mainland Japan.</p>

            <h2>Annexation and War</h2>
            <p>Japan annexed the Ryukyu Kingdom in 1879, creating Okinawa Prefecture and forcing the last king into exile. Assimilation policies suppressed Ryukyuan languages and culture; Okinawans faced discrimination as inferior Japanese. The Battle of Okinawa (April-June 1945) was WWII's bloodiest Pacific battle—estimated 100,000-150,000 Okinawan civilians died (roughly quarter of the population), caught between American invasion and Japanese military that sometimes used them as human shields or forced suicides. This trauma marks Okinawan memory; peace activism remains strong. US occupation followed (until 1972), establishing military bases that still dominate the islands.</p>

            <h2>US Military Bases</h2>
            <p>Okinawa hosts approximately 70% of US military facilities in Japan, occupying about 15% of Okinawa's main island. This concentration—dating to occupation and Cold War strategy—creates ongoing controversy. Noise pollution, accidents (including crashes and crimes), environmental damage, and land occupation generate resentment. Okinawans have repeatedly voted against bases; Tokyo and Washington proceed regardless. The Henoko base construction, opposed by Okinawa's governor and population, exemplifies the conflict. Many Okinawans see this as colonial treatment—bearing Japan's security burden disproportionately. The base issue dominates Okinawan politics and identity.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Ryukyuan</h2>
            <p>Modern Okinawans maintain distinct identity within Japan. Ryukyuan languages are UNESCO-listed as endangered; revival efforts grow but transmission remains weak. Traditional arts—eisa dancing, sanshin music, bingata textiles—flourish. Okinawa markets its "resort" image but economic dependency on bases and tourism limits development. Independence movements exist (minoritarian); more common are demands for reduced base presence and greater autonomy. UN bodies have recommended Japan recognize Ryukyuans as indigenous people—Japan has refused. How Okinawans navigate Japanese identity, distinctive heritage, and military occupation shapes their future as Japan's only subtropical prefecture with unique historical experience.</p>
