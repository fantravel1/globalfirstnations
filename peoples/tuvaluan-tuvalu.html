            <h2>Who Are the Tuvaluans?</h2>
            <p>The Tuvaluans are a Polynesian people numbering approximately 11,000 in Tuvalu—the world's fourth-smallest country—plus several thousand in diaspora (mainly New Zealand and Fiji). They speak Tuvaluan, a Polynesian language, and inhabit nine coral atolls scattered across 900,000 square kilometers of Pacific Ocean. With a maximum elevation of 4.5 meters and average of 2 meters, Tuvalu is among Earth's most vulnerable nations to climate change. The Tuvaluans face the prospect of becoming climate refugees—losing not just homes but potentially their entire nation, sovereignty, and cultural homeland to rising seas.</p>

            <h2>Polynesian Culture</h2>
            <p>Tuvaluan culture reflects Polynesian heritage adapted to tiny coral atolls. Fatele—traditional communal dancing with rhythmic song—remains central to celebrations and identity. The falekaupule (traditional assembly) governs island affairs alongside modern structures. Extended family (kāiga) networks provide social security. Fishing and coconut cultivation traditionally sustained communities; today, remittances from overseas workers and revenue from the ".tv" internet domain (fortuitously matching "television") support the economy. Christian faith (predominantly Protestant, introduced by missionaries) pervades society. This culture, developed over centuries on these remote atolls, faces displacement if the islands become uninhabitable.</p>

            <h2>Climate Catastrophe</h2>
            <p>Tuvalu is climate change's most visible victim. Rising seas flood homes during king tides; saltwater intrusion contaminates freshwater supplies; coral bleaching threatens food security; storm surges become more destructive. Scientific projections suggest parts of Tuvalu could be uninhabitable by 2050; complete inundation is possible within this century. Tuvaluans have contributed essentially nothing to global emissions yet face losing everything. The nation has been vocal in international climate forums, calling the situation "a slow-motion catastrophe" and demanding action from major emitters. How the world responds—or fails to respond—to Tuvalu's plight tests climate justice commitments.</p>

            <h2>Sovereignty Questions</h2>
            <p>If Tuvalu becomes uninhabitable, unprecedented questions arise: What happens to its sovereignty, UN membership, exclusive economic zone (valuable for fishing rights)? Can a nation exist without territory? Tuvalu has explored purchasing land in Fiji for climate refugees and digitally preserving cultural heritage. Australia and New Zealand have offered some migration pathways, but these involve cultural dissolution—Tuvaluans becoming minorities in other countries rather than citizens of their own nation. The government has declared Tuvalu will maintain statehood "in perpetuity" regardless of physical displacement. These legal and existential questions have no precedent.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Tuvalu</h2>
            <p>Modern Tuvaluans increasingly emigrate—to New Zealand, Fiji, Australia—seeking economic opportunity and climate security. Those remaining depend heavily on remittances, aid, and the .tv domain revenue (which earned millions annually). Traditional culture persists but faces pressure from emigration, modernization, and the looming crisis. Young Tuvaluans grow up knowing their homeland may not exist for their grandchildren. Whether Tuvaluans can maintain cultural identity in diaspora, what happens to those unable to leave, and how the world should assist climate refugees are defining questions. Tuvalu's fate previews what many low-lying nations face.</p>
