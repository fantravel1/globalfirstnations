            <h2>Who Are the Hmong?</h2>
            <p>The Hmong (Mong) are an ethnic group originating from southern China, now dispersed across Southeast Asia and, through refugee resettlement, the Western world. Total population is approximately 11-12 million: about 9 million in China (where they are called Miao, though this includes related groups), 1 million in Vietnam, 600,000 in Laos, 250,000 in Thailand, and over 300,000 in the United States. They speak Hmong (Hmongic) languages of the Hmong-Mien family. The Hmong have maintained distinct identity despite centuries of marginalization, migration, and pressure from majority populations. Their involvement in the "Secret War" in Laos (1961-1975), fighting alongside the CIA against communist forces, led to massive refugee flight after 1975 and eventual resettlement in Western countries.</p>

            <h2>Highland Adaptation</h2>
            <p>The Hmong traditionally practiced swidden (slash-and-burn) agriculture in mountainous terrain above 1,000 meters, growing rice, corn, and vegetables, with opium poppy as a cash crop until recent suppression. This highland adaptation was partly defensive—remote mountains provided refuge from lowland states. The Hmong developed remarkable knowledge of mountain environments, including extensive pharmacopoeia of medicinal plants. Villages were autonomous, led by clan elders and ritual specialists. Clans (xeem) are patrilineal and exogamous—the 18 major clans create kinship networks spanning national borders. Hmong mobility—willingness to relocate for better land or to escape oppression—has been constant throughout their history, contributing to their wide dispersal.</p>

            <h2>Textile Arts</h2>
            <p>Hmong textile arts, particularly paj ntaub ("flower cloth"), are globally recognized. Women create intricate geometric designs through batik, embroidery, appliqué, and cross-stitch on indigo-dyed cloth. Traditionally, these decorated women's clothing—particularly the elaborate New Year outfits that displayed a woman's skill and family wealth. Different Hmong subgroups (White Hmong, Green/Blue Hmong, etc.) are distinguished partly by costume variations. Story cloths (paj ntaub dab neeg), developed in refugee camps after 1975, depict narratives of Hmong history, the Secret War, and refugee experience—a new art form that emerged from trauma. Textile production continues in diaspora communities as cultural practice and income source, with Hmong Americans selling traditional crafts while adapting designs for new markets.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Hmong</h2>
            <p>Modern Hmong live across dramatically different contexts. In China, Miao autonomous areas provide some cultural recognition, though economic development pressures traditional lifestyles. In Laos, the Hmong remain marginalized, with some communities still persecuted for alleged support of post-war insurgency. Thai Hmong face citizenship issues despite generations of residence. The American Hmong community (concentrated in California, Minnesota, and Wisconsin) has achieved educational and economic mobility while struggling to maintain culture across generations. Hmong Americans have entered politics, academia, and professions. Generational conflicts emerge between elders maintaining traditional practices (clan governance, shamanism, bride wealth) and youth adapting to American norms. Hmong New Year celebrations, held across diaspora communities, bring together these diverse experiences while affirming shared identity.</p>
