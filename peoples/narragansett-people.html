            <h2>Who Are the Narragansett?</h2>
            <p>The Narragansett are an Algonquian-speaking people of Rhode Island, with approximately 2,800 enrolled members in the Narragansett Indian Tribe (federally recognized 1983). Their name means "People of the Small Point"—referring to geographic features of their homeland. They spoke Narragansett, closely related to Wampanoag and other southern New England Algonquian languages, now largely dormant with revival efforts underway. The Narragansett dominated Rhode Island and parts of Connecticut before colonization, controlling the wampum trade. Their devastating defeat in King Philip's War (1675-76) nearly destroyed them, but survivors persisted on a small reservation that became Rhode Island's only tribal land.</p>

            <h2>Wampum Power</h2>
            <p>Before colonization, the Narragansett controlled wampum production—the shell bead currency that dominated Native exchange systems throughout the Northeast. Wampum was manufactured from quahog clams along Narragansett Bay; purple beads (from the quahog's interior) were especially valuable. This control made the Narragansett wealthy and politically powerful. When Europeans recognized wampum as currency, Narragansett wealth increased further. Roger Williams, founder of Rhode Island, initially maintained good relations, but land pressure and colonial expansion eventually overwhelmed diplomacy.</p>

            <h2>Great Swamp Fight</h2>
            <p>The Great Swamp Massacre (December 19, 1675) devastated the Narragansett. During King Philip's War, colonial militia attacked the Narragansett's fortified winter village in the Rhode Island swamps—despite Narragansett attempts to remain neutral. Colonists burned the village, killing an estimated 600-1,000 people, mostly non-combatants. Survivors joined the war against the colonists; by war's end, Narragansett power was broken. Survivors were enslaved, scattered, or confined to tiny reservations. The Great Swamp Fight is commemorated annually—a massacre remembered as a monument to colonial violence and Narragansett survival.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Narragansett</h2>
            <p>Modern Narragansett have rebuilt from near-extinction. Federal recognition (1983) followed a 1978 land claims settlement returning 1,800 acres. Gaming efforts have been blocked by state opposition—an ongoing legal and political battle. Without gaming revenue, economic development remains challenging. Cultural programs maintain traditions; the annual August Meeting has been held since 1676. Language revitalization works to restore Narragansett. The tribe operates social services, housing, and education programs. A controversial 2003 raid by state police on a tribally-licensed smoke shop raised sovereignty issues. How the Narragansett resolve gaming disputes while maintaining cultural continuity shapes this Rhode Island people's future.</p>
