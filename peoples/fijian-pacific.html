            <h2>Who Are the iTaukei?</h2>
            <p>The iTaukei (indigenous Fijians) are the original inhabitants of Fiji, an archipelago of over 300 islands in the South Pacific. Approximately 475,000 iTaukei live in Fiji, comprising about 57% of the population alongside Indo-Fijians and other groups. The iTaukei are Melanesian with Polynesian influences, speaking Fijian (Vosa Vakaviti) and English. Traditional society organized around mataqali (clans) and vanua (land units), with elaborate chiefly systems. Despite colonial disruption and political tensions with Indo-Fijian communities, iTaukei maintain distinctive cultural practices including yaqona ceremonies and communal village life.</p>

            <h2>Vanua: Land, People, Spirit</h2>
            <p>The concept of vanua is central to iTaukei identity, encompassing land, people, and spiritual connections in an inseparable whole. Every iTaukei belongs to a vanua—a territory, community, and set of relationships with ancestors and nature. Land in Fiji is predominantly held communally by mataqali, protecting iTaukei from landlessness despite colonial and economic pressures. This system has caused tensions with landless communities but remains fundamental to iTaukei identity. To be disconnected from one's vanua is to lose identity itself.</p>

            <h2>The Yaqona Ceremony</h2>
            <p>Yaqona (kava) ceremonies are essential to iTaukei social and political life. The mildly intoxicating drink, made from pepper root, is shared in ceremonies marking everything from welcoming guests to installing chiefs to mourning deaths. Elaborate protocols govern who sits where, who speaks, and how the tanoa (kava bowl) is served. Refusing yaqona is a serious insult. The ceremony creates bonds, resolves disputes, and connects participants to ancestors. Even modern Fijian political events begin with yaqona, and the practice has spread globally through diaspora.</p>

            <h2>Chiefly Systems</h2>
            <p>Traditional iTaukei society is hierarchical, with chiefs (turaga) holding spiritual as well as political authority. The highest chiefs include the Vunivalu (warlord) and Roko Tui (paramount chief) of various confederacies. Chiefly status passes through complex hereditary rules. Chiefs lead ceremonies, mediate disputes, and represent their people to the state. The Great Council of Chiefs, though suspended, represented traditional authority in modern governance. Tension between democratic and chiefly principles continues in Fijian politics, with some advocating for enhanced chiefly roles.</p>

            <h2>Meke and Performance</h2>
            <p>Meke is traditional Fijian performance combining dance, song, and story to convey history, mythology, and social values. Men's meke often feature war movements; women's meke emphasize graceful arm movements. Costumes include bark cloth, leaves, and flowers. Different regions have distinctive meke styles. Performance traditions remain vital—meke is performed for tourists but also for community celebrations, welcoming ceremonies, and cultural festivals. The Fiji Arts Council and community groups work to preserve and transmit meke knowledge to younger generations.</p>
