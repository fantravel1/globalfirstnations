            <h2>Who Are the San?</h2>
            <p>The San (historically called Bushmen, though some consider this pejorative) are the indigenous hunter-gatherer people of southern Africa, numbering approximately 100,000 across Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, Angola, Zimbabwe, and Zambia. They speak Khoisan languages famous for click consonants—among the world's most phonetically complex languages. The San are southern Africa's first peoples, with archaeological evidence of their ancestors dating back 20,000+ years. Their rock art, spread across thousands of sites, represents one of humanity's longest artistic traditions. Dispossessed and marginalized over centuries, the San now struggle for land rights and cultural survival.</p>

            <h2>Hunter-Gatherer Heritage</h2>
            <p>The San practiced hunter-gatherer lifestyles for tens of thousands of years. Men hunted with poisoned arrows (using beetle larvae toxin); women gathered plants, providing most calories. This mobile lifestyle required intimate environmental knowledge—tracking animals, finding water, identifying hundreds of plant species. Social organization was egalitarian—no chiefs, decisions by consensus, sharing mandatory. Trance dances connected communities to the spirit world; healers entered altered states to cure illness and bring rain. This sustainable lifestyle persisted until displacement by pastoralists and colonizers. Some San communities maintain modified hunting-gathering; most have been forced into different livelihoods.</p>

            <h2>Rock Art</h2>
            <p>San rock art—paintings and engravings across southern Africa—represents humanity's longest continuous artistic tradition, spanning 20,000+ years. Thousands of sites preserve images of animals, humans, and abstract designs. Early interpreters saw simple hunting scenes; current understanding recognizes spiritual meanings—paintings often depict trance experiences, depicting therianthropes (human-animal figures), entoptic phenomena (geometric patterns seen in altered consciousness), and ritual activities. This art provides windows into San spirituality and cognition. Sites like Drakensberg (South Africa) and Tsodilo Hills (Botswana) are UNESCO World Heritage sites, preserving this extraordinary heritage.</p>

            <h2>Dispossession and Marginalization</h2>
            <p>San history is one of progressive dispossession. Bantu-speaking pastoralists arriving ~2,000 years ago pushed San into marginal lands. European colonization brought genocide—Cape Colony settlers hunted San; San resisted but were decimated. By the 20th century, survivors were marginalized farm workers or desert refugees. The Botswana government's relocation of San from the Central Kalahari Game Reserve (1997-2006) drew international condemnation; San won court cases but implementation remains contested. San rank among the world's most marginalized peoples—facing discrimination, poverty, loss of language, and denial of traditional livelihoods.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary San</h2>
            <p>Modern San face extreme challenges: poverty, alcoholism, cultural erosion, and land loss. Traditional hunting is often illegal; economic alternatives are few. Some San communities have developed cultural tourism, though benefits are uneven. Intellectual property fights over traditional knowledge (like hoodia plant for appetite suppression) highlight exploitation. Language preservation is urgent—many San languages have only elderly speakers. Yet advocacy grows: San organizations demand recognition; international attention increases; some countries acknowledge San land rights. How San preserve cultural identity while achieving economic security, and whether governments genuinely support their rights, will determine whether these first peoples of southern Africa survive as distinct communities.</p>
