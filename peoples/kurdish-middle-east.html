            <h2>Who Are the Kurds?</h2>
            <p>The Kurds are an Iranian people numbering 30-45 million—the world's largest ethnic group without their own state. They inhabit a contiguous region ("Kurdistan") spanning Turkey (15-20 million), Iran (8-12 million), Iraq (6-7 million), and Syria (2-3 million), plus diaspora communities globally. They speak Kurdish, comprising several related languages (Kurmanji, Sorani, others). The Kurds trace their history to ancient Medes and have maintained distinct identity despite never achieving unified statehood. Post-WWI borders divided Kurdistan; subsequent decades brought repression, genocide, and ongoing struggles for autonomy or independence.</p>

            <h2>Division and Repression</h2>
            <p>The post-WWI Treaty of Sèvres (1920) promised Kurdish autonomy, but the Treaty of Lausanne (1923) divided Kurdistan among Turkey, Iraq, Syria, and Iran. Each state pursued assimilation or suppression. Turkey banned Kurdish language and denied Kurdish existence (calling them "Mountain Turks"); Iraq's Ba'athist regime committed genocide (Anfal campaign, 1988, killed 100,000+ including Halabja chemical attack); Iran has repressed Kurdish movements; Syria denied citizenship to many Kurds. This division means Kurdish experience varies dramatically by country—from Iraq's autonomous region to Turkey's ongoing conflict.</p>

            <h2>Peshmerga and Resistance</h2>
            <p>Kurdish resistance has taken various forms. The Peshmerga ("those who face death") are Iraqi Kurdistan's military forces; they've fought Iraqi governments, Saddam Hussein, and ISIS. In Turkey, the PKK (Kurdistan Workers' Party) has waged armed insurgency since 1984, killing tens of thousands; Turkey, the US, and EU designate it terrorist while Kurds see it differently. Syrian Kurds' YPG forces proved crucial in defeating ISIS, creating de facto autonomy in northeastern Syria. Women fighters, particularly in Rojava (Syrian Kurdistan), have gained international attention. Kurdish military capability has been both asset and liability in seeking international support.</p>

            <h2>Iraqi Kurdistan</h2>
            <p>Iraqi Kurdistan has achieved the greatest Kurdish autonomy—functioning as a semi-independent state since 1991 when a no-fly zone protected it from Saddam. The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) has its own parliament, military, and foreign relations. The 2017 independence referendum passed overwhelmingly but was rejected by Baghdad and the international community; Iraq retook Kirkuk and disputed territories. Internal divisions between the KDP and PUK parties complicate governance. Economic struggles (oil revenue disputes with Baghdad, corruption) challenge development. Yet Iraqi Kurdistan demonstrates what Kurdish self-governance might look like.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Kurdish Issues</h2>
            <p>Kurdish experiences diverge by state: Iraqi Kurdistan navigates autonomy within Iraq; Syrian Kurds face uncertain futures as Turkish threats continue; Iranian Kurds protest regime oppression (notably after Mahsa Amini's 2022 death); Turkish Kurds face ongoing conflict and repression. The diaspora—especially in Germany—maintains cultural activism. Kurds have proven important geopolitical actors (anti-ISIS allies, regional balance) yet remain pawns in great power games. Whether Kurds can achieve statehood, meaningful autonomy, or simply cultural rights varies by context. The "Kurdish question" remains the Middle East's largest unresolved national issue.</p>
