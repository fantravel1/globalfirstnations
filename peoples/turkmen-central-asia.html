            <h2>Who Are the Turkmen?</h2>
            <p>The Turkmen are a Turkic people numbering approximately 7 million—5.5 million in Turkmenistan, with significant populations in Iran (2 million), Afghanistan, Iraq, and other countries. They speak Turkmen, an Oghuz Turkic language related to Turkish and Azerbaijani. Historically, the Turkmen were pastoral nomads and fierce warriors who raided settled areas; their tribal confederation never formed a centralized state until Soviet creation of Turkmenistan. They're famous for Akhal-Teke horses and intricate carpets. Modern Turkmenistan, ruled by bizarre personality cults, remains one of the world's most closed societies despite vast natural gas reserves.</p>

            <h2>Akhal-Teke Horses</h2>
            <p>The Akhal-Teke is one of the world's oldest and most distinctive horse breeds—tall, slender, with a metallic sheen to their coats (especially the famous golden coloring). Bred for thousands of years in the Karakum Desert's oases, these horses were essential to Turkmen raiders' success; cavalry mounted on Akhal-Tekes could cover vast distances in desert conditions. The bond between Turkmen and their horses was intimate—horses slept in tents, were covered in blankets, and fed by hand. Today, the Akhal-Teke appears on Turkmenistan's state emblem; breeding remains prestigious, though the regime's obsessions have sometimes harmed breeding programs.</p>

            <h2>Turkmen Carpets</h2>
            <p>Turkmen carpets—characterized by geometric gul (medallion) patterns in deep reds—are among Central Asia's most valuable textiles. Each major tribe (Tekke, Yomut, Saryk, Ersari) has distinctive patterns; experts can identify origin from design. Traditional carpets used vegetable dyes and were woven on portable looms suited to nomadic life. Carpets served as floor coverings, tent decorations, camel bags, and valuable trade goods. The carpet appears on Turkmenistan's flag—one of the world's most intricate national flags. While industrial production has increased, traditional carpet-making continues as cultural heritage and income source.</p>

            <h2>Personality Cult</h2>
            <p>Turkmenistan has experienced extreme personality cults. Saparmurat Niyazov (ruled 1985-2006) renamed himself Turkmenbashi ("Father of the Turkmen"), built gold statues (one rotated to face the sun), renamed months after his family, and mandated study of his quasi-religious book Ruhnama. His successor Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow continued personality cult while promoting different obsessions—horses, dogs (Alabai breed), bicycles, health. A third president was installed in 2022. Meanwhile, the population faces restrictions on travel, internet, and information while gas revenues benefit elites. Turkmenistan remains among the world's most repressive states.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Turkmenistan</h2>
            <p>Turkmenistan's vast natural gas reserves (world's fourth-largest) could make it wealthy, but revenues are opaque and largely benefit the ruling elite. The state provides free utilities but restricts freedoms; the economy struggles outside hydrocarbons. Tribal and regional identities persist beneath official nationalism. Information is so controlled that even basic statistics are unreliable. The Turkmen diaspora in Iran maintains traditions; those in Turkmenistan navigate bizarre state demands while preserving cultural practices—horses, carpets, hospitality—despite repression. How Turkmenistan might eventually reform or transition remains unknown given its extreme isolation.</p>
