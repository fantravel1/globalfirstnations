            <h2>Who Are the Mossi?</h2>
            <p>The Mossi are the largest ethnic group in Burkina Faso, numbering approximately 8-10 million (over 50% of the national population), with additional communities in Ghana, Côte d'Ivoire, and diaspora elsewhere. They speak Mòoré (Mossi), a Gur language of the Niger-Congo family. The Mossi established powerful kingdoms—the Mossi Kingdoms (11th-19th centuries)—that successfully resisted Islamic jihads and maintained independence until French colonization. The Mogho Naaba (king) of Ouagadougou remains a significant traditional authority. Known for distinctive masks used in funeral ceremonies and their historical resistance to outside domination, the Mossi dominate Burkina Faso's politics, economy, and culture.</p>

            <h2>Mossi Kingdoms</h2>
            <p>The Mossi Kingdoms (Ouagadougou, Yatenga, Tenkodogo, and others) were among West Africa's most powerful and enduring states. Founded by horseback warriors who conquered indigenous populations and established a ruling dynasty, the kingdoms developed sophisticated administration, cavalry armies, and strong monarchical tradition. Uniquely, they resisted Islamization—maintaining traditional religion and practices while surrounding peoples converted. This resistance preserved distinct Mossi identity. French conquest (1896-1897) ended political independence but not traditional authority. The Mogho Naaba of Ouagadougou continues performing weekly ceremonies and holds significant moral authority in modern Burkina Faso.</p>

            <h2>Masks and Ceremony</h2>
            <p>Mossi masks, particularly those used in funeral ceremonies by the Nyonyose (original inhabitants absorbed by Mossi conquerors), are among West Africa's most distinctive. Tall, geometric forms—sometimes over 2 meters—represent ancestors and spiritual forces. The masks appear during funerals, ensuring proper transition of the deceased to ancestral realm. This tradition belongs to specific lineages among the commoner population (not the ruling nakomsé class). Mossi masks have influenced modern art and are collected globally, though their primary function remains sacred and ceremonial. The survival of masking traditions alongside Islam and Christianity demonstrates Mossi religious synthesis.</p>

            <h2>Migration and Diaspora</h2>
            <p>The Mossi have a long migration tradition. Historically, young men traveled to coastal Ghana and Côte d'Ivoire for wage labor on cocoa plantations, returning home with earnings. This circular migration continues—Mossi communities exist throughout West Africa and increasingly in Europe. Burkina Faso is one of Africa's poorest countries; remittances from migrants are economically crucial. The diaspora maintains strong ties to home villages, often returning for ceremonies and contributing to local development. Yet migration also creates social strain—absent fathers, delayed marriages, and changing family structures. The Mossi experience exemplifies Sahelian migration patterns.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Mossi</h2>
            <p>Modern Mossi face Burkina Faso's severe challenges: poverty, desertification, limited healthcare and education, and—since 2015—devastating jihadist insurgency. The violence has displaced millions, destroyed communities, and threatens the state. Traditional Mossi areas, once relatively stable, now face attacks. The Mogho Naaba has advocated for peace while navigating between government and traditional roles. Political instability (coups in 2022) compounds challenges. Yet Mossi cultural identity remains strong—the language thrives, ceremonies continue, and the traditional chieftaincy adapts. How Mossi navigate conflict, climate change, and poverty while preserving cultural heritage defines their contemporary crisis.</p>
