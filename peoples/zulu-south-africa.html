            <h2>Who Are the Zulu?</h2>
            <p>The Zulu (amaZulu, "People of the Heavens") are the largest ethnic group in South Africa, numbering approximately 12 million people, primarily in KwaZulu-Natal province. The Zulu rose to regional prominence in the early 19th century under King Shaka, who built a powerful military kingdom that defeated British forces at the Battle of Isandlwana in 1879. Today, Zulu language (isiZulu) is South Africa's most widely spoken home language. The Zulu maintain strong cultural identity through traditional governance, ceremonies, and the symbolic role of the Zulu monarch.</p>

            <h2>The Age of Shaka</h2>
            <p>Shaka kaSenzangakhona (c. 1787-1828) transformed the Zulu from a minor clan into a powerful kingdom through military innovation. He developed the iklwa (short stabbing spear) and isihlangu (large shield), created the regimental system organizing warriors by age, and employed encirclement tactics that devastated opponents. The period of rapid Zulu expansion—the Mfecane—reshaped southern African demographics. Though assassinated by his half-brothers, Shaka's legacy endures in Zulu identity, military symbolism, and the praise poetry (izibongo) still recited honoring his achievements.</p>

            <h2>Resistance and Resilience</h2>
            <p>The Zulu fought multiple wars against colonial powers. At Isandlwana (1879), Zulu warriors annihilated a British column, inflicting Britain's worst defeat against indigenous forces. Despite ultimate defeat, Zulu resistance became legendary. Under apartheid, the Zulu "homeland" of KwaZulu was created, with traditional leaders incorporated into the system. Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi led the Inkatha Freedom Party, sometimes in violent conflict with the ANC. Post-apartheid, Zulu traditional governance continues alongside democratic structures, with the Zulu king recognized constitutionally.</p>

            <h2>Ubuntu and Philosophy</h2>
            <p>The Zulu concept of ubuntu ("I am because we are") expresses fundamental beliefs about human interconnection and community responsibility. Ubuntu emphasizes compassion, collective welfare, and the dignity inherent in all people. Archbishop Desmond Tutu popularized ubuntu as an African contribution to global ethics. Traditional Zulu society organized around values of respect (hlonipha), especially toward elders, ancestors, and the natural world. These philosophical foundations continue shaping Zulu community life and influenced South Africa's transition from apartheid.</p>

            <h2>Ceremonies and Traditions</h2>
            <p>Zulu life cycles are marked by ceremonies including umemulo (coming-of-age for women), umshado (marriage), and ancestral rituals connecting living and dead. The annual Reed Dance (Umkhosi Womhlanga) brings together thousands of young Zulu women to present reeds to the Zulu queen. Traditional dress—including beadwork indicating marital status and region—remains important for ceremonies. Sangomas (traditional healers) and inyangas (herbalists) maintain spiritual and healing traditions. While Christianity is widespread, Zulu often practice both, seeing no contradiction between church and ancestor veneration.</p>
