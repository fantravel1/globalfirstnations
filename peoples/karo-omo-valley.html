            <h2>Who Are the Karo?</h2>
            <p>The Karo (also Kara) are one of the smallest ethnic groups in Ethiopia's Lower Omo Valley, numbering only about 1,500-3,000 people. They are world-famous for their extraordinary body and face painting, using natural pigments to create elaborate designs for ceremonies, courtship, and daily decoration. Living along the eastern banks of the Omo River in one of Africa's most ethnically diverse regions, the Karo maintain a precarious existence through flood-retreat agriculture, fishing, and cattle herding while facing existential threats from dam construction and commercial agriculture.</p>

            <h2>Body Art as Expression</h2>
            <p>Karo body painting represents one of Africa's most sophisticated artistic traditions. Using white chalk, yellow mineral deposits, red ochre, and charcoal, Karo artists create intricate designs on faces, torsos, and limbs. Patterns range from simple dots and lines to complex geometric designs mimicking animal skins (especially guinea fowl, favored for their spotted plumage). Each design carries meaning: indicating age group, clan affiliation, social status, or simply aesthetic choice.</p>
            <p>Body painting serves multiple functions. For ceremonies and dances, elaborate designs demonstrate creativity and attract mates. Young men paint themselves to impress women; women decorate to enhance beauty. Some patterns indicate mourning or celebration; others mark life transitions. The impermanence of body paint—washed away and reapplied—makes it a continuously renewed art form, with individuals experimenting with new designs while respecting traditional patterns.</p>

            <h2>Scarification and Adornment</h2>
            <p>Beyond painting, the Karo practice extensive body modification. Scarification, created by cutting the skin and rubbing ash or plant substances into wounds to create raised keloid patterns, marks major life events. Men who have killed an enemy (from hostile neighboring tribes) receive specific chest scars. Women's scarification on the torso and face indicates beauty and tribal identity. These permanent marks complement temporary body paint.</p>
            <p>Elaborate hairstyles and adornments complete Karo aesthetics. Hair is styled with clay and butter into intricate forms; feathers, beads, and other materials are added for decoration. Men wear clay caps painted in colors indicating status. Women string beads into elaborate necklaces and headbands. This attention to bodily appearance reflects a culture where personal presentation is a form of art, communication, and social participation.</p>

            <h2>Life Along the Omo</h2>
            <p>The Karo's survival depends on the Omo River's annual flood cycle. As floodwaters recede, they plant sorghum, maize, and beans in the rich alluvial soil—a technique called "flood-retreat" or "recession" agriculture requiring precise timing and river knowledge. Fishing supplements crop production, as does limited cattle herding. The river provides water for drinking, washing, and the mud used in body painting and construction.</p>
            <p>Karo villages perch on bluffs overlooking the river, with views across the dramatic Omo Valley landscape. Houses are simple structures of wood and grass. Each village contains a dancing ground where ceremonies, dances, and social events take place. Age-set systems organize male society, with elaborate initiation ceremonies marking transitions between life stages. These initiations feature the body painting that brings the Karo international attention.</p>

            <h2>Existential Threats</h2>
            <p>The completion of Ethiopia's Gibe III dam in 2015 threatens Karo existence. The dam regulates the Omo's flow, eliminating the natural flooding upon which Karo agriculture depends. Without floods, the river's banks no longer receive fertile silt, and crops fail. The Ethiopian government's plan includes irrigation schemes that have not materialized for the Karo, while commercial sugar plantations have seized traditional lands.</p>
            <p>International human rights organizations have documented the crisis: food insecurity, displacement, and government pressure to abandon traditional lands and lifestyles. The Karo, too small and remote to effectively resist, face absorption into larger groups or dispersal. Their body painting tradition, captured by photographers and tourists, may survive longer than the community itself. The situation represents a broader pattern across the Lower Omo, where development projects threaten indigenous peoples without their consent.</p>

            <h2>Tourism and Survival</h2>
            <p>Tourism provides mixed blessings. Photographers, documentary filmmakers, and adventure tourists seek out the Karo for their spectacular body art. This brings income—Karo villagers charge fees for photographs—but also raises concerns about cultural commodification and exploitation. Some observers worry that performances for tourists degrade authentic ceremonies; others note that tourism provides the only economic alternative as traditional subsistence fails.</p>
            <p>The Karo face a fundamental dilemma: how to survive when the environmental basis of their existence disappears. Younger Karo increasingly speak Amharic, attend government schools, and consider migration to towns. Traditional knowledge of plants, seasons, and river ecology becomes less relevant. Whether the Karo will survive as a distinct people, or whether their famous body painting will become museum memory, depends on factors largely beyond their control.</p>
