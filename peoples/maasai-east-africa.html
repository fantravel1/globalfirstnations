            <h2>Who Are the Maasai?</h2>
            <p>The Maasai are a Nilotic pastoral people of approximately 2 million in southern Kenya and northern Tanzania. They speak Maa, a Nilotic language. The Maasai are among Africa's most recognized peoples—their distinctive red shuka cloth, elaborate beadwork, warrior traditions, and cattle-centered lifestyle have become global symbols of African culture. Historically feared warriors who dominated the Rift Valley, the Maasai have maintained cultural practices despite colonialism and modern pressures. Their relationship with wildlife and savanna ecosystems makes them central to East African conservation debates.</p>

            <h2>Cattle Culture</h2>
            <p>Cattle are central to Maasai life—wealth, social status, diet, and spiritual meaning all revolve around livestock. The Maasai believe Enkai (God) gave them all cattle, making cattle-keeping their divine calling. Traditional diet consisted primarily of milk, blood (drawn from living cattle), and meat. Cattle are rarely slaughtered except for ceremonies; they're accumulated as wealth and exchanged in bride-price. Cattle raids against neighbors were historically common. This pastoral lifestyle requires vast grazing lands; competition with agriculture, conservation areas, and urban expansion threatens Maasai land access. Cattle remain identity markers even as livelihoods diversify.</p>

            <h2>Age-Set System</h2>
            <p>Maasai society organizes through age-sets—groups of males initiated together who progress through life stages collectively. Boys become junior warriors (moran) through circumcision ceremonies, entering years of warriorhood protecting communities and livestock. Moran live in separate camps, grow distinctive hair, and embody warrior ideals. Graduation to elderhood brings marriage rights and political authority. Women have parallel age organization. This system creates cross-clan solidarity and structures social obligations. While some aspects have modified (moran periods shortened, education integrated), age-sets remain fundamental to Maasai social organization.</p>

            <h2>Land and Conservation</h2>
            <p>Maasai have lost vast territories to colonialism, national parks, and agricultural expansion. Kenya's Maasai Mara and Tanzania's Serengeti—Africa's premier wildlife destinations—were Maasai lands; creation of parks displaced communities. Contemporary debates center on conservation-community relations: Can Maasai benefit from wildlife tourism? Should they participate in conservation management? Some models (conservancies) share revenue and involve Maasai in wildlife protection; others exclude them. Climate change intensifies pressure—drought kills livestock, forcing difficult adaptations. The Maasai struggle to maintain pastoralism while their land base shrinks.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Maasai</h2>
            <p>Modern Maasai face rapid change. Education increasingly reaches Maasai children, though tensions exist between schooling and pastoralism. Some Maasai have become professionals—doctors, lawyers, politicians—while maintaining cultural identity. Cultural tourism provides income but raises authenticity concerns. Women's rights movements challenge aspects of traditional gender roles (particularly early marriage and female circumcision). Land subdivision threatens communal grazing. Yet Maasai cultural pride remains strong—the distinctive dress, ceremonies, and community structures persist. How Maasai adapt economically while preserving cultural identity defines their contemporary challenge.</p>
