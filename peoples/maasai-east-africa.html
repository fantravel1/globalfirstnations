            <h2>Who Are the Maasai?</h2>
            <p>The Maasai (Masai) are semi-nomadic pastoralists inhabiting Kenya and Tanzania, numbering approximately 1.5-2 million people. Among Africa's most internationally recognized indigenous peoples, the Maasai have maintained distinctive traditions including cattle-centered economy, warrior culture, and the iconic red shúkà cloaks. The Maasai share their land with East Africa's great wildlife migrations, a coexistence now complicated by conservation policies and tourism. Despite pressure to settle and modernize, many Maasai continue herding cattle across the savanna as their ancestors have for centuries.</p>

            <h2>Cattle Are Life</h2>
            <p>For the Maasai, cattle are wealth, food, currency, and spiritual connection. Traditional Maasai diet consisted largely of cattle products—meat, milk, and blood. Cattle determine social status; a wealthy man might own hundreds. Cattle are rarely slaughtered except for ceremonies; instead, they circulate through bride-wealth, gifts, and loans that build social relationships. The Maasai believe Enkai (God) gave all cattle to them—a belief that historically justified raiding other peoples' herds. While modern Maasai diversify their economy, cattle remain central to identity and social organization.</p>

            <h2>Warrior Culture</h2>
            <p>Maasai men progress through age-sets, with the morani (warrior) phase being most culturally significant. Young men undergo eunoto (junior warrior initiation) and spend years as warriors, distinguished by elaborate hairstyles, red ochre body paint, and traditional weapons. Warriors historically protected cattle and raided neighboring groups. The famous adumu (jumping dance) demonstrates morani strength. Though lion hunting as a warrior test is now illegal, the warrior ethos continues. Maasai warriors have become tourism attractions, though commodification raises questions about cultural authenticity.</p>

            <h2>Land and Conservation Conflict</h2>
            <p>Maasai lands contain some of Africa's most famous wildlife areas, including the Maasai Mara and Ngorongoro. Colonial and post-colonial governments created parks and reserves that restricted Maasai land use, sometimes evicting communities entirely. Tourism revenues rarely reach Maasai villages. Meanwhile, farming and urbanization pressure traditional grazing routes. Some Maasai have developed community conservancies, attempting to benefit from wildlife while maintaining pastoral life. These conflicts illustrate tensions between indigenous land rights, conservation, and development across Africa.</p>

            <h2>Adapting While Resisting</h2>
            <p>The Maasai face constant pressure to abandon pastoralism for settled agriculture or wage labor. Yet they have proven remarkably adaptive while maintaining core cultural elements. Maasai serve in governments, business, and education while returning to villages for ceremonies. Cell phones are common; traditional dress remains standard. Maasai women's beadwork sells internationally. Some Maasai embrace tourism while others resist commodification of their culture. The Maasai demonstrate that indigenous identity can persist through—not despite—engagement with modernity.</p>
