            <h2>Who Are the Chin People?</h2>
            <p>The Chin (also known as Zo, Zomi, or by specific group names like Mizo, Hakha, Falam) are a Tibeto-Burman ethnic group of approximately 1.5 million people inhabiting the mountainous Chin State in western Myanmar and Mizoram State in northeast India. Comprising dozens of subgroups with distinct languages, the Chin have historically lived in dispersed villages practicing slash-and-burn agriculture. British colonialism, Christian missionary activity, and post-independence conflicts have transformed Chin society. Traditional face tattooing among women, now dying out, has made Chin culture internationally known.</p>

            </div>

            <h2>Face Tattoos</h2>
            <p>Chin women's facial tattoos are among the world's most striking body modification traditions. Patterns varied by subgroup—some featuring intricate spiderwebs, others geometric lines covering the entire face. Tattooing began around puberty using thorns and soot. Explanations vary: beauty enhancement, protection from kidnapping by neighboring peoples, spiritual protection, or group identification. British and Christian missionaries discouraged the practice, which ended by the 1960s-70s. Today, only elderly women bear tattoos, making them subjects of tourism photography. The tradition's end marks profound cultural change within living memory.</p>

            <h2>Christianity's Transformation</h2>
            <p>American Baptist missionaries arrived in Chin territory in the late 19th century, achieving remarkable conversion rates—today over 90% of Chin identify as Christian. Christianity provided literacy, education, and connections beyond isolated villages. It became central to pan-Chin identity, unifying diverse subgroups. Churches became primary social institutions; Christian holidays replaced traditional festivals. This transformation was so complete that traditional religion is nearly extinct. Chin Christianity tends toward evangelical forms; Chin missionaries now work globally. Faith shapes Chin identity as profoundly as ethnicity or language.</p>

            <h2>The Chin National Front</h2>
            <p>Armed resistance began shortly after Myanmar's independence. The Chin National Front (CNF) and its armed wing have fought since 1988 for autonomy and rights. Unlike resource-rich regions, Chin State lacks valuable commodities—it remains Myanmar's poorest state, with chronic food insecurity. Conflict has been lower-intensity than elsewhere but persistent. The 2021 coup sparked renewed resistance; Chin communities formed local defense forces. International Chin diaspora—in Malaysia, India, and Western countries—support homeland communities and advocacy. Political aspirations range from federal autonomy to outright independence.</p>

            <h2>Diaspora Communities</h2>
            <p>Decades of conflict and poverty have driven substantial Chin emigration. Malaysia hosts perhaps 100,000 Chin, mostly undocumented and vulnerable to exploitation. India's Mizoram State, ethnically related, provides refuge. Resettlement programs brought thousands to the United States, Australia, and Europe. American Chin communities, concentrated in Indianapolis and other cities, maintain churches, associations, and cultural practices. The diaspora sends remittances, advocates internationally, and grapples with identity transmission to children growing up far from ancestral mountains.</p>
