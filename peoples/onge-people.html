            <h2>Who Are the Onge?</h2>
            <p>The Onge are an indigenous Andamanese people of Little Andaman Island, India, numbering approximately 100-120 people. They speak Önge, an Andamanese language distinct from other Andamanese languages despite geographic proximity. The Onge have maintained more traditional lifestyle than the Great Andamanese, though they too have experienced dramatic population decline—from an estimated 670 in 1901 to under 100 by 1990. Unlike the hostile Sentinelese, the Onge accepted contact but have experienced the typical consequences: disease, dependency, and cultural disruption. Their territory has been reduced and encroached upon by settlement and development.</p>

            <h2>Traditional Lifeways</h2>
            <p>Traditional Onge economy centered on hunting wild pigs, fishing, collecting honey, and especially hunting sea turtles. The Onge developed sophisticated knowledge of turtle behavior, migration, and hunting techniques. Dugout canoes enabled maritime resource exploitation. Forest products including fruits, roots, and honey supplemented protein sources. The Onge lived in temporary camps, moving seasonally to exploit different resources. Their territory encompassed Little Andaman Island (about 730 km²), but settlement has restricted them to a much smaller reserve. Traditional practices including hunting and foraging continue alongside government rations, creating a mixed economy.</p>

            <h2>Population Decline</h2>
            <p>The Onge experienced severe population decline following sustained contact. From approximately 670 people in 1901, numbers fell to 250 by 1951, 100 by 1991, and bottomed out at 96 in 2004. Disease, especially epidemics of flu and measles, caused most deaths. Fertility decline, possibly linked to introduced diseases affecting reproductive health, prevented recovery. Settlement encroachment reduced their territory and resource base. Government policies relocated Onge to settlements where rations were distributed, creating dependency. The 2004 tsunami killed several Onge, though most survived by fleeing to high ground. Recent counts suggest slight recovery to around 120, though the population remains critically small.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Onge</h2>
            <p>Modern Onge live in two settlements—Dugong Creek and South Bay—within a reduced tribal reserve covering about 26% of Little Andaman. The rest of the island has been opened to settlement and plantation development. Onge receive government rations (rice, dal, cloth) supplementing traditional foods. Some continue hunting and gathering; others have become more sedentary. Alcohol, introduced by contact, has caused social problems. The Onge language is endangered, with children increasingly speaking Hindi. Cultural practices including ceremonies and traditional knowledge face erosion. The Onge represent a middle case between the destroyed Great Andamanese and the isolated Sentinelese—survived but diminished, maintaining some traditions while dependent on outside support.</p>
