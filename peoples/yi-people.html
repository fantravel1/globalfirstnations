            <h2>Who Are the Yi?</h2>
            <p>The Yi (also Nuosu, Lolo) are one of China's largest ethnic minorities, numbering approximately 9 million people across Yunnan, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Guangxi provinces. They speak various Yi languages, part of the Tibeto-Burman family, and possess their own ancient syllabic script. The Yi historically maintained independent kingdoms in the mountainous regions of southwestern China, with a highly stratified society featuring a hereditary aristocracy and slave caste. Their spectacular Torch Festival, held on the 24th-26th days of the sixth lunar month, attracts millions of visitors and has become a symbol of Yi identity. The Yi represent one of China's most culturally distinctive and historically significant minorities.</p>

            <h2>Mountain Kingdoms</h2>
            <p>The Yi maintained independent or semi-independent kingdoms in the mountainous regions of Yunnan and Sichuan for centuries, resisting incorporation into the Chinese state. The Nanzhao Kingdom (738-902 CE) and Dali Kingdom (937-1253 CE) in Yunnan had significant Yi influence, though historians debate the extent. In the Liangshan (Cool Mountains) of Sichuan, Yi society remained independent until the 1950s, organized into a rigid caste system. The nuohuo aristocracy held power; below them were commoners, and at the bottom were gaxy (slaves) who could be bought, sold, and inherited. Bimo (priests) performed rituals and maintained the Yi syllabic script. This traditional society was dramatically transformed after Communist reforms in the 1950s, which abolished the caste system and slavery.</p>

            <h2>Torch Festival</h2>
            <p>The Torch Festival is the Yi's most celebrated tradition, a three-day event featuring massive bonfires, torch processions, and various competitions. Villages erect huge torches; people carry smaller torches through fields and homes to drive away evil spirits and pests, ensure good harvests, and celebrate summer. Athletic competitions include wrestling, bull fighting, horse racing, and beauty contests. Traditional songs, dances, and costumes showcase Yi culture. The festival's origins are explained through multiple myths involving heroes defeating monsters or evil spirits with fire. The Torch Festival has been designated a Chinese national intangible cultural heritage and draws large numbers of domestic and international tourists, particularly to Liangshan and Chuxiong Yi autonomous regions.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Yi</h2>
            <p>Modern Yi society has transformed dramatically since 1949. The caste system was abolished; land was redistributed; former slaves gained freedom. Education expanded; literacy increased. However, Liangshan remains one of China's poorest regions; economic development lags behind eastern China. Poverty alleviation campaigns have brought infrastructure but also cultural disruption. The Yi languages face pressure from Mandarin Chinese, though the standardized Yi script is taught in schools. Traditional practices including Bimo rituals continue, though simplified. The Torch Festival thrives as cultural showcase and tourist attraction. Yi music and dance gain national attention; Yi pop artists have achieved commercial success. The Yi navigate between maintaining cultural distinctiveness and participating in China's rapid modernization, with results varying across different Yi regions and communities.</p>
