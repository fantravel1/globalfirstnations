            <h2>Who Are the Rappahannock?</h2>
            <p>The Rappahannock (meaning "people of the alternating stream" or "where the tide ebbs and flows") are a Virginia Algonquian tribe originally inhabiting the Rappahannock River valley in the tidewater and piedmont regions. Numbering approximately 300 enrolled members, they are one of Virginia's state-recognized tribes who achieved federal recognition in 2018 as part of the Thomasina E. Jordan Indian Tribes of Virginia Federal Recognition Act. They speak English today; the Virginia Algonquian language is extinct. Unlike some Virginia tribes who retained reservations, the Rappahannock lost their land base entirely during the colonial period, maintaining community cohesion without territorial concentration—only recently acquiring tribal land through purchases. Their persistence demonstrates how indigenous communities survive dispersed among non-Native populations.</p>

            <h2>Colonial History</h2>
            <p>The Rappahannock were part of the broader Powhatan world, though their exact relationship to the Powhatan Confederacy is debated—they may have been tributary, allied, or independent. English colonization devastated the Rappahannock as it did all Virginia Algonquians. Wars, disease, and land loss reduced the population dramatically. By 1700, only small remnant groups remained. Unlike the Pamunkey and Mattaponi who retained treaty reservations, the Rappahannock were eventually dispossessed entirely, their lands absorbed into colonial Virginia's expanding plantation economy. Without a land base, the Rappahannock maintained community through kinship, intermarriage, and informal gatherings, becoming largely invisible to official records while continuing to exist as a distinct people.</p>

            <h2>Survival Without Land</h2>
            <p>The Rappahannock survival strategy differed from reservation-based tribes. Scattered among non-Native Virginians, they maintained identity through family networks, shared oral history, and community events. Marriage within the community preserved distinctiveness. Church congregations, particularly Baptist churches, provided institutional structure when tribal governance was suppressed. Like other Virginia Indians, the Rappahannock faced the 1924 Racial Integrity Act's attempt to eliminate indigenous identity—Walter Plecker's campaign to classify all non-whites as "colored" targeted them. Community members carefully maintained genealogies and historical documentation despite official erasure. This "invisible" period lasted until the civil rights era enabled renewed tribal organization and state recognition (1983). The Rappahannock experience illustrates how indigenous identity persists without territorial concentration.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Rappahannock</h2>
            <p>Modern Rappahannock have achieved federal recognition (2018), the culmination of decades of effort. This recognition brings government-to-government relationship and access to federal programs. The tribe has purchased land in their ancestral territory, establishing a headquarters and beginning to rebuild territorial presence. Cultural revitalization includes documenting oral traditions, researching archaeology, and educational programs. The tribe operates a cultural center and participates in intertribal events. Economic development is nascent; gaming remains a possibility though not without controversy. The Rappahannock, along with other federally recognized Virginia tribes (Chickahominy, Upper Mattaponi, Monacan, Nansemond, Pamunkey), are revitalizing Virginia's indigenous presence after centuries of erasure. Their story demonstrates that even total land loss and official denial cannot extinguish indigenous identity when community commitment persists.</p>
