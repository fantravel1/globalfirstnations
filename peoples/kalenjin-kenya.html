            <h2>Who Are the Kalenjin?</h2>
            <p>The Kalenjin are a Nilotic ethnic group inhabiting the highlands of Kenya's Rift Valley Province. Comprising several subgroups including the Nandi, Kipsigis, Tugen, Marakwet, and Pokot, they share closely related languages and cultural practices centered on cattle herding and agriculture. The Kalenjin have achieved extraordinary international recognition for producing the world's greatest concentration of elite long-distance runners, winning hundreds of Olympic and World Championship medals.</p>

            <h2>The Running Phenomenon</h2>
            <p>Kalenjin runners have dominated middle and long-distance running for decades. Since the 1960s, they have won approximately 75% of major international distance races. The phenomenon defies simple explanation—scientists point to genetic factors including efficient running biomechanics, thin ankles and calves, and high slow-twitch muscle fiber ratios. High-altitude training (2,000-2,500 meters), running to school as children, cultural emphasis on running for cattle herding, and the economic incentive of prize money all contribute. Towns like Iten and Eldoret have become global training centers.</p>

            <h2>Age-Set System and Initiation</h2>
            <p>Traditional Kalenjin society organizes males into age-sets (ipinda) that move through life stages together. Initiation rituals marking the transition to adulthood historically involved circumcision performed without anesthesia or showing pain—demonstrating the courage and stoicism that remain cultural values. Each generation receives a distinctive age-set name. Age-mates maintain lifelong bonds, supporting each other through life's challenges. Though modernized, age-set identity remains important, and initiation ceremonies continue in adapted forms.</p>

            <h2>Cattle Culture</h2>
            <p>Like many Nilotic peoples, the Kalenjin traditionally centered life around cattle. Cattle represented wealth, social status, and spiritual well-being. Bridewealth payments in cattle formalized marriages and created bonds between families. The Kalenjin developed sophisticated knowledge of cattle breeding, disease prevention, and pasture management. Though many Kalenjin now engage in agriculture and modern employment, cattle remain culturally significant. Cattle raids between groups were historically common, considered tests of young warriors' bravery.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Challenges</h2>
            <p>Despite running success bringing international fame and individual wealth, many Kalenjin communities face challenges including land disputes, ethnic tensions, and limited economic opportunities beyond athletics. Climate change affects traditional pastoralism, while population growth strains resources. Political involvement has sometimes led to conflict with neighboring groups. The running success story, while inspiring, can obscure these challenges and create pressure on young Kalenjin to pursue athletics. Cultural institutions adapt as communities navigate modernization while preserving identity.</p>
