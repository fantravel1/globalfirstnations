            <h2>Who Are the Teleut?</h2>
            <p>The Teleut are an indigenous Turkic people living primarily in Kemerovo Oblast (Kuzbass) and parts of the Altai Republic, Russia, numbering approximately 2,500-3,000. They speak Teleut, a Turkic language sometimes classified as a dialect of Southern Altai. Known historically as "White Kalmyks" (a misnomer—they are not related to the Mongolic Kalmyks), the Teleut were steppe pastoralists who also practiced agriculture. Their history includes periods as an independent or semi-independent tribal confederation before Russian absorption in the 17th-18th centuries. Today they live in scattered communities within the Kuzbass coal region and the Altai.</p>

            <h2>Historical Significance</h2>
            <p>The Teleut held historical importance in the 17th century as a tribal confederation controlling strategic territory between the Russian Empire extending from the north and the Dzungar (Oirat) Mongol Empire from the south. Russian documents from this period detail relations with Teleut leaders. The Teleut paid tribute variously to Russia and to the Dzungars depending on political circumstances. Russian colonization gradually restricted Teleut territory; the defeat of the Dzungars by the Qing in the 18th century eliminated their alternative alignment. By the 19th century, Teleut had become Russian subjects, their pasturelands converted to agricultural and mining uses.</p>

            <h2>Traditional Crafts</h2>
            <p>The Teleut developed distinctive material culture reflecting their steppe pastoralist heritage. Women's clothing featured elaborate embroidery with geometric and floral patterns. Metal jewelry and ornamentation included distinctive styles. Felt production and processing of animal products provided essential materials. Traditional clothing, especially wedding garments, displayed cultural identity through color, pattern, and construction. These craft traditions are maintained by cultural activists and ensembles today, even as daily wear has long since adopted Russian styles. Museums in Kemerovo Oblast preserve Teleut material culture, though living practice has diminished.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Teleut</h2>
            <p>Modern Teleut live in several communities in Kemerovo Oblast, particularly in Bekovo, Shanda, and other settlements in the Belovo district. Like the Shor, they inhabit one of Russia's most industrialized regions, with coal mining dominating the economy and environment. The Teleut language is critically endangered; perhaps only a few hundred elderly speakers remain. Most Teleut speak Russian as their primary language. Cultural organizations work to document and revive traditions; folk ensembles perform Teleut songs and dances. The small, scattered population and industrial transformation of their homeland pose severe challenges. How the Teleut maintain distinct identity amid the Kuzbass industrial complex remains their central struggle.</p>
