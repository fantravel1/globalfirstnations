            <h2>Who Are the Ryukyuan People?</h2>
            <p>The Ryukyuan people (Uchinanchu in Okinawan) are the indigenous inhabitants of the Ryukyu Islands, spanning from southern Kyushu to Taiwan. With a population of approximately 1.5 million, they are ethnically, linguistically, and culturally distinct from the Yamato Japanese. The Ryukyuans developed an independent kingdom (1429-1879) with unique traditions, languages, and cultural practices. Recognized by UN human rights bodies as an indigenous people, they faced forced assimilation after Japanese annexation in 1879 and suffered disproportionately during WWII's Battle of Okinawa. Today, they maintain distinct identity while navigating pressures from Japanese assimilation and US military presence.</p>

            <h2>Ryukyuan Languages and Culture</h2>
            <p>Ryukyuan languages form a separate branch of the Japonic language family, as different from Japanese as Spanish is from French. Six distinct Ryukyuan languages exist: Okinawan, Kunigami, Miyako, Yaeyama, Yonaguni, and Amami—all critically endangered. UNESCO classifies them as endangered, with elderly speakers remaining. The traditional culture includes unique performing arts like Ryukyuan dance and kumiodori theater, eisa drum dancing, distinctive cuisine featuring goya (bitter melon) and Okinawa soba, textile arts including bingata dyeing, and spiritual practices blending animism, ancestor worship, and Buddhism. The traditional religion centers on yuta (female shamans) and noro (priestesses) who communicate with spirits and ancestors.</p>

            <h2>The Ryukyu Kingdom Legacy</h2>
            <p>The Ryukyu Kingdom (1429-1879) was an independent maritime trading nation that prospered through commerce with China, Japan, Korea, and Southeast Asia. The kingdom developed a unique tributary relationship with both Ming/Qing China and Satsuma domain of Japan, skillfully navigating between great powers. Shuri Castle in Naha served as the royal palace and political center. The kingdom banned weapons (enforced unarmed martial arts that evolved into karate), developed sophisticated diplomacy, and created a distinct aristocratic culture blending Chinese and indigenous elements. Japanese annexation in 1879 forcibly ended this independence, initiating systematic cultural suppression.</p>

            <h2>Forced Assimilation and World War II</h2>
            <p>After annexation, Japan implemented aggressive assimilation policies: banning Ryukyuan languages in schools, forcing Standard Japanese, destroying cultural sites, and suppressing traditional practices. During WWII, the Battle of Okinawa (1945) killed approximately one-quarter of Okinawa's civilian population—over 100,000 people. Okinawans were used as human shields, forced into mass suicides, and saw their island devastated. Post-war US occupation (1945-1972) further marginalized Ryukyuan culture while establishing massive military bases that still occupy 15% of Okinawa Island, creating ongoing tensions over land rights, environmental damage, and sovereignty.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Indigenous Rights Movement</h2>
            <p>Modern Ryukyuan activists advocate for recognition of indigenous rights, language revitalization, reduction of US military presence, environmental protection, and cultural preservation. The Association of the Indigenous Peoples in the Ryukyus (AIPR) works internationally for UN recognition. Language revitalization programs operate in schools and communities. Traditional performing arts are maintained through organized transmission. However, challenges persist: all Ryukyuan languages remain endangered, youth increasingly identify only as Japanese, economic dependence on military bases creates political divisions, and Japanese government denies formal indigenous recognition domestically despite international acknowledgment.</p>
