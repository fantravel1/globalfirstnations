            <h2>Who Are the Mohawk?</h2>
            <p>The Mohawk (Kanienʼkehá꞉ka, meaning "People of the Flint") are the easternmost nation of the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Confederacy, historically inhabiting the Mohawk Valley in present-day New York State. Today approximately 30,000 Mohawk live in communities across New York, Ontario, and Quebec, including the notable territories of Akwesasne (straddling the US-Canada border), Kahnawake (near Montreal), and Six Nations of the Grand River (Ontario). They speak Mohawk (Kanien'kéha), a Northern Iroquoian language. As "Keepers of the Eastern Door," the Mohawk protected the confederacy's eastern flank. They became famous as "Mohawk ironworkers" who built New York's skyscrapers, and for political activism including the 1990 Oka Crisis that brought indigenous land rights to international attention.</p>

            <h2>The Haudenosaunee Confederacy</h2>
            <p>The Mohawk are founding members of the Haudenosaunee ("People of the Longhouse") Confederacy, established according to tradition by the Peacemaker and Hiawatha, perhaps in the 12th-15th century. The confederacy united five nations (Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, Seneca; Tuscarora joined in 1722) under the Great Law of Peace—one of the world's oldest participatory democracies. Each nation maintained autonomy while joining in council for common concerns. The Mohawk contributed nine sachems (chiefs) to the Grand Council. This political system influenced American founders—the Albany Plan of Union and elements of the US Constitution drew on Haudenosaunee models. The clan system (Bear, Wolf, Turtle among Mohawk) organizes social life, with clan mothers holding significant political power including the authority to select and remove chiefs.</p>

            <h2>Mohawk Ironworkers</h2>
            <p>Mohawk men from Kahnawake became legendary high-steel construction workers beginning in the 1880s when a bridge was built across the St. Lawrence River adjacent to their reserve. Demonstrating remarkable aptitude for high-altitude work, Mohawk crews spread across North America, constructing iconic structures including the Empire State Building, Chrysler Building, World Trade Center, and countless bridges. Entire families relocated to Brooklyn's "Little Caughnawaga" neighborhood. This dangerous profession—with significant fatalities—became central to modern Mohawk male identity. The 9/11 attacks killed several Mohawk ironworkers; many more participated in recovery and reconstruction at Ground Zero. This tradition continues today, with Mohawk ironworkers prominent in major construction projects.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Mohawk</h2>
            <p>Modern Mohawk communities are politically diverse and often assertive about sovereignty. The 1990 Oka Crisis began when Quebec police attempted to raid a Mohawk barricade protecting a burial ground from golf course expansion; a 78-day armed standoff followed, bringing Canadian indigenous issues to global attention. Mohawk communities have asserted jurisdiction over taxation, border crossing, and governance, sometimes conflicting with US and Canadian authorities. The Akwesasne territory, divided by the international border and multiple jurisdictions, faces unique challenges. Mohawk language revitalization has achieved notable success—immersion schools have produced new generations of speakers. Traditional governance (Longhouse) coexists and sometimes conflicts with elected band councils. Economic activities include gaming, manufacturing, and construction. The Mohawk demonstrate how indigenous nations can maintain sovereignty claims and cultural vitality while engaging with modern economies.</p>
