            <h2>Who Are the Awá-Guajá?</h2>
            <p>The Awá-Guajá (or simply Awá) are a critically endangered nomadic indigenous people of the eastern Amazon in Maranhão state, Brazil. Numbering approximately 450-500 contacted individuals plus an unknown number of uncontacted groups, they are considered by Survival International to be "Earth's most threatened tribe." They speak Awá, a Tupí-Guaraní language, and traditionally practiced a fully nomadic hunting and gathering lifestyle without agriculture—rare among Amazonian peoples. Their territories overlap with those of the Guajajara, who now protect them as part of the Guardians of the Forest initiative. Illegal logging, land invasion, and violence threaten their survival.</p>

            <h2>Nomadic Hunters</h2>
            <p>The Awá are among the few remaining nomadic hunter-gatherers in Amazonia. Traditional bands moved constantly through the forest, hunting game (peccaries, monkeys, deer, birds), gathering wild fruits and honey, and fishing. They did not practice agriculture, making them distinct from most neighboring peoples. Temporary shelters were constructed quickly during travels. Intimate forest knowledge enabled survival without permanent cultivation. Special relationships existed with the forest itself—the Awá kept orphaned animals as pets, nurturing baby monkeys, coatis, and other creatures. This nomadic lifestyle depended on extensive, intact forest. Contact, sedentarization, and forest destruction have fundamentally altered Awá subsistence, though hunting remains important for contacted communities.</p>

            <h2>Extreme Vulnerability</h2>
            <p>The Awá face extraordinary threats. Their territories in Maranhão are among Brazil's most active deforestation frontiers; illegal logging operations have penetrated indigenous reserves. Some Awá groups remain uncontacted and flee deeper into shrinking forests. Violence accompanies logging—Awá have been killed by loggers and settlers. Disease epidemics following contact decimated populations. Brazil's FUNAI established protected posts, but understaffing and underfunding limit protection. International campaigns—particularly Survival International's advocacy—brought global attention, leading to Brazilian government operations against illegal logging in 2014. Yet pressure continues; the current political climate has weakened indigenous protections. The Awá's survival depends on effective territorial protection and respect for uncontacted groups' choice of isolation.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Awá</h2>
            <p>Contacted Awá communities now live in semi-permanent settlements on demarcated reserves, combining hunting with introduced agriculture and government assistance. The transition from nomadism has been traumatic; traditional knowledge adapted to mobility becomes less relevant in sedentary life. Health services address previously unknown diseases. Some Awá children attend schools. The relationship with neighboring Guajajara has become protective—Guajajara Guardians patrol Awá territories against loggers. Uncontacted Awá groups remain in the forest, their situation precarious as deforestation advances. The Awá case illustrates the extreme vulnerability of nomadic peoples to land invasion and the inadequacy of government protection for Brazil's most isolated indigenous communities.</p>
