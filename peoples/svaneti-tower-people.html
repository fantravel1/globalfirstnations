            <h2>Who Are the Svans?</h2>
            <p>The **Svans** are a Georgian subgroup inhabiting **Svaneti**, the highest inhabited region in the Caucasus Mountains, where peaks exceed 5,000 meters and glaciers dominate the landscape. Numbering approximately **30,000 people** (with only about 14,000 remaining in Svaneti itself), the Svans have preserved a remarkably archaic culture due to their geographic isolation—cut off by snow for months each year, their valleys maintained traditions lost elsewhere in Georgia. They are famous for their **medieval defensive towers** (koshkebi), which dot the landscape and give villages like Ushguli and Mestia their distinctive appearance. The Svans speak **Svan**, a distinct South Caucasian language not mutually intelligible with Georgian, and maintain unique musical traditions, religious syncretism, and blood feud customs that echo medieval Europe.</p>

            <h2>The Towers of Svaneti</h2>
            <p>Svaneti's landscape is defined by **defensive towers** built between the 9th and 13th centuries, some reaching 25 meters in height. Every significant family (machubi) possessed a tower, serving as refuges during attacks and symbols of clan status. During blood feuds—which persisted into the 20th century—families could shelter in towers for months or years. The towers were also used to protect community treasures: Svaneti's churches contain extraordinary medieval **icons, manuscripts, and gold work** that survived invasions precisely because the inaccessible region was never conquered by Mongols, Persians, or Ottomans. Villages like **Ushguli** (among Europe's highest inhabited settlements at 2,200 meters) and **Mestia** preserve clusters of towers, making Svaneti a UNESCO World Heritage Site and growing tourist destination.</p>

            <h2>Blood Feud and Honor Culture</h2>
            <p>Svan society traditionally operated through **blood feud** (lakhvroba)—cycles of vengeance killing between clans that could span generations. A killing demanded retribution; failure to avenge brought shame on the entire clan. Elaborate rules governed feuds: which relatives could be targeted, how reconciliation might be achieved, and what compensation (blood price) could end conflicts. The towers served as refuges for those under threat. Soviet authorities suppressed feuding, but it persisted underground and has partially revived since independence. This honor culture also produced remarkable hospitality obligations—guests are sacred, protected even at cost of the host's life. The combination of fierce vengeance and absolute hospitality characterized a society where honor regulated social order in the absence of strong state authority.</p>

            <h2>Religion and Ritual</h2>
            <p>Svan religion blends Orthodox Christianity with older practices in distinctive syncretism. **Lamaria**, a female deity associated with the moon and fertility, remains venerated alongside Christian saints. Traditional animal sacrifices (still practiced at some festivals) coexist with church liturgy. The **Lipanali** (winter solstice) and **Kvirikoba** (summer) festivals feature unique Svan traditions including sacred songs and community feasting. Svan polyphonic singing—distinct from Georgian polyphony—is particularly notable, featuring archaic harmonies that may preserve medieval or even pre-Christian musical structures. Churches contain remarkable medieval frescoes and metalwork; the Svaneti Museum of History and Ethnography in Mestia houses treasures that would be national-level exhibits elsewhere but accumulated here through centuries of protective isolation.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Svaneti</h2>
            <p>Today's Svaneti faces depopulation as younger generations migrate to Tbilisi and beyond. The Svan language is endangered—while older people speak it fluently, transmission to children has weakened. Yet cultural revival efforts are underway: language programs, documentation projects, and heritage tourism provide economic incentives for preservation. A new road and ski resort development have improved accessibility, bringing both opportunity and threats of cultural erosion and environmental damage. Climate change melts the glaciers that define Svan landscape and lifestyle. The towers that protected Svans for a millennium now attract tourists whose money may determine whether mountain communities survive. Svaneti's future depends on balancing development with preservation—maintaining the fierce independence that kept this culture distinct for so long.</p>
