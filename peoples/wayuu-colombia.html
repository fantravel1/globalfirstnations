            <h2>Who Are the Wayuu?</h2>
            <p>The Wayuu are the largest indigenous group in Colombia and the second largest in Venezuela, numbering approximately 600,000 people inhabiting the Guajira Peninsula—a semi-arid region extending into the Caribbean Sea. Never conquered by Spanish colonizers, the Wayuu maintained independence through fierce resistance and the peninsula's harsh desert environment. Today, they are famous for their colorful woven bags (mochilas), matrilineal society, and unique legal system that resolves conflicts through negotiation and compensation.</p>

            <h2>Mochila Wayuu: Woven Identity</h2>
            <p>The mochila Wayuu is a hand-woven bag that has become an international fashion icon. Taking 15-30 days to create, each mochila features unique geometric patterns called "kanás" that may represent elements of daily life, animals, or abstract concepts. Patterns are passed through maternal lines, and each weaver adds personal creativity. Originally practical carrying bags, mochilas now sell globally, providing crucial income for Wayuu women. The Colombian government has sought protected designation of origin to prevent imitations.</p>

            <h2>Matrilineal Clans</h2>
            <p>Wayuu society organizes around matrilineal clans (eirükü) tracing descent through mothers. Children belong to their mother's clan, property passes through female lines, and clan identity determines marriage rules. The mother's brother often plays a larger role in children's lives than the biological father. Wayuu women, particularly elders, hold significant authority within families and clans. This matrilineal system has persisted despite surrounding patriarchal cultures, demonstrating the strength of Wayuu social organization.</p>

            <h2>The Palabrero: Conflict Resolution</h2>
            <p>The Wayuu developed a sophisticated conflict resolution system centered on the "palabrero" (word-carrier), specialized mediators who negotiate settlements between disputing parties. Rather than punishment, justice focuses on compensation—payment in livestock, goods, or money to repair harm done. This system, recognized by UNESCO as Intangible Cultural Heritage, handles everything from theft to homicide. Palabreros spend years learning negotiation arts and conflict jurisprudence. The system reduces violence and maintains social cohesion without relying on state courts many Wayuu distrust.</p>

            <h2>Water Crisis</h2>
            <p>The Guajira Peninsula's desert climate means water scarcity defines Wayuu life. Traditionally, the Wayuu migrated seasonally and managed water resources carefully. Today, climate change intensifies droughts while government neglect limits infrastructure development. Child malnutrition and death from water-related illness have reached crisis levels, drawing international condemnation. The Colombian state faces legal orders to address the humanitarian situation. The crisis illustrates how indigenous peoples often bear the worst consequences of climate change and governmental failure.</p>
