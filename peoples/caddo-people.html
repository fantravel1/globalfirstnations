            <h2>Who Are the Caddo?</h2>
            <p>The Caddo Nation of Oklahoma (federally recognized) has approximately 6,000 enrolled members. Their name "Kadohadacho" means "True Chiefs" or "Real Chiefs." They speak Caddo, the namesake of the Caddoan language family, with fewer than 25 fluent speakers remaining. Originally inhabiting the Red River valley and adjacent areas of present-day Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, and Oklahoma, the Caddo built impressive mound centers and maintained complex chiefdoms. The Spanish named the region "Tejas" (Texas) from a Caddo word meaning "friends"—giving the state its name. The Caddo represent the southeastern-most extension of Plains culture.</p>

            <h2>Mound Centers</h2>
            <p>The Caddo built impressive ceremonial mound centers throughout their territory. Sites like Spiro (Oklahoma), Crenshaw (Arkansas), and George C. Davis (Texas) featured platform mounds supporting temples and elite residences, arranged around plazas. The Caddo shared cultural elements with Mississippian societies to the east—the Southern Cult or Southeastern Ceremonial Complex. Spiro, looted in the 1930s, yielded spectacular artifacts now scattered in museums and private collections. Mound building, intensive agriculture, and complex social hierarchy distinguished the Caddo from their Plains neighbors. They represented the westernmost extension of Southeastern Woodland traditions.</p>

            <h2>Colonial Devastation</h2>
            <p>European contact devastated the Caddo. Spanish missions disrupted traditional life; French trade brought goods but also conflicts. Epidemic diseases repeatedly swept through villages—smallpox, measles, and other illnesses killed perhaps 95% of the population between 1690 and 1800. By the early 19th century, consolidated survivors numbered only a few thousand. The Texas Republic and later the United States pushed the Caddo from their homeland; by 1859, survivors had removed to Indian Territory (Oklahoma). The formerly powerful chiefdoms had been reduced to refugee communities far from their mound-building ancestors' lands.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Caddo</h2>
            <p>Modern Caddo in Oklahoma work to preserve culture after centuries of decline. Language revitalization programs work with elderly speakers to document and teach Caddo—but with fewer than 25 fluent speakers, the language is critically endangered. The tribe operates gaming facilities and provides services from headquarters in Binger, Oklahoma. The Turkey Dance, traditional pottery, and other cultural practices continue. Archaeological sites in Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana connect contemporary Caddo to their mound-building past. How the Caddo preserve language and cultural heritage while building economic capacity shapes this true chiefs' future.</p>
