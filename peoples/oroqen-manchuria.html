            <h2>Who Are the Oroqen?</h2>
            <p>The Oroqen (also spelled Orochen) are a Tungusic-speaking people of northeastern China's Greater Khingan Mountains, one of the last hunting peoples of the Manchurian taiga. Numbering approximately 8,600, they traditionally lived as nomadic hunters pursuing deer, elk, bear, and smaller game through the vast boreal forests straddling the Chinese-Russian border. Their name means "people using reindeer" in their Tungusic language, though unlike their Siberian relatives, the Oroqen used reindeer primarily for transport rather than herding.</p>

            <h2>Forest Hunters</h2>
            <p>Traditional Oroqen life centered on hunting. Men tracked game through the taiga on foot or on horseback (after acquiring horses from Mongol neighbors), using bows, spears, and later rifles. Each clan controlled specific hunting territories, moving between camps following game migrations and seasonal resources. The forest provided everything: meat, hides for clothing and shelter, birch bark for containers and canoes, and medicinal plants.</p>
            <p>Hunting required deep knowledge of animal behavior, forest ecology, and survival skills. Oroqen hunters could track prey for days, knew the sounds and signs of dozens of species, and could survive in temperatures reaching -50°C. This expertise made them valuable to both Chinese and Japanese authorities during various conflicts, though exploitation by outsiders decimated game populations and disrupted traditional territories.</p>

            <h2>Birch Bark Culture</h2>
            <p>Birch bark was the Oroqen's most important material, used for everything from housing to containers to canoes. The distinctive Oroqen tent (sierrankén) was covered with birch bark sheets carefully harvested and sewn together. Birch bark containers stored food, clothing, and sacred objects; birch bark canoes allowed river travel; and elaborate birch bark boxes decorated with traditional patterns held valuables.</p>
            <p>Working birch bark was women's art. They harvested bark at the proper season, processed it to maintain flexibility, and created containers and decorations combining utility with beauty. Carved and painted designs featured nature motifs—animals, plants, and geometric patterns with symbolic meanings. This craft tradition, while less practiced now, continues through cultural revival programs and museum collections.</p>

            <h2>Shamanism</h2>
            <p>Oroqen religion centered on shamanism, with shamans (saman) serving as healers, diviners, and intermediaries with the spirit world. The cosmos was populated by spirits inhabiting animals, plants, mountains, rivers, and other natural features. Maintaining proper relationships with these spirits ensured hunting success, health, and community welfare. The shaman, wearing an elaborate costume representing spiritual power, entered trances to negotiate with spirits on the community's behalf.</p>
            <p>Hunting itself was ritualized. Before pursuing major game, hunters conducted ceremonies asking animal spirits for permission and promising proper treatment. Killed animals were thanked and ritually processed according to specific rules. Bear hunting was particularly sacred, accompanied by elaborate ceremonies similar to those of the Nivkh and other north Asian peoples. These practices reflected a worldview in which humans and animals were connected in ongoing reciprocal relationships.</p>

            <h2>Transformation and Settlement</h2>
            <p>The 20th century brought catastrophic change. Japanese occupation, civil war, and Communist consolidation disrupted traditional life. The 1958 "settling down" campaign moved Oroqen from the forest into permanent villages, ending nomadism. Collective farming and forestry work replaced hunting. Children attended schools teaching in Mandarin, breaking language transmission. By the time the hunting ban came in 1996 (ostensibly for wildlife conservation), the transition from hunting culture was largely complete.</p>
            <p>Today, few Oroqen have ever hunted. The language is nearly extinct—while census figures show 8,600 ethnic Oroqen, fewer than 1,000 speak the language fluently, and almost none under 40 are fluent speakers. Government compensation and welfare support those who surrendered hunting rifles, but many struggle with the transition from a life centered on forest skills to modern wage labor or unemployment.</p>

            <h2>Cultural Revival Efforts</h2>
            <p>Despite near-total cultural disruption, revival efforts continue. The Oroqen Autonomous Banner in Inner Mongolia maintains cultural institutions, museums, and festivals. Traditional crafts, especially birch bark work, are taught and promoted. Elders record stories and songs for preservation. Some ecotourism initiatives attempt to share Oroqen heritage with visitors while providing economic alternatives.</p>
            <p>Yet the challenges are immense. Economic marginalization, alcoholism, and social dislocation afflict many Oroqen communities. Young people see little future in traditional culture and migrate to cities. The forest itself is diminished by logging and development. Whether any meaningful continuity of Oroqen culture will survive another generation is uncertain—their story represents both the richness of human adaptation to challenging environments and the fragility of small-scale societies facing overwhelming external pressure.</p>
