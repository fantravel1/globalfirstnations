            <h2>Who Are the Nuristani?</h2>
            <p>The Nuristani are an indigenous people of the Hindu Kush mountains in northeastern Afghanistan and northwestern Pakistan. Until 1896, their homeland was called "Kafiristan" (land of the infidels) because they maintained an ancient Indo-European polytheistic religion while surrounded by Islamic societies. After forced conversion, the region was renamed "Nuristan" (land of light). The Nuristani preserve distinctive languages, architecture, and cultural practices reflecting their unique historical position.</p>

            <h2>The Lost Religion</h2>
            <p>Pre-Islamic Nuristani religion fascinated outside observers as a survival of ancient Indo-European belief systems. A pantheon of gods ruled different aspects of life: Imra (creator), Moni (protector of crops), Gish (war god), and Disani (fertility goddess). Worship occurred in carved wooden temples and sacred groves. Priests maintained fire altars and conducted animal sacrifices. The religion shared features with ancient Vedic religion and pre-Zoroastrian Iranian beliefs, offering glimpses into prehistoric religious traditions. Though Nuristanis are now Muslim, some cultural practices retain pre-Islamic elements.</p>

            <h2>Mountain Architecture</h2>
            <p>Nuristani villages cascade down steep mountainsides in clusters of multi-story wooden and stone houses. These structures represent remarkable engineering adaptations to extreme terrain. Houses feature flat roofs that serve as terraces for neighbors above, carved wooden pillars, and elaborate decorative elements. The most distinctive structures were the "jast" or men's houses—large communal buildings with carved columns representing ancestors and deities. Much traditional architecture was damaged during decades of war, though some villages retain historic buildings.</p>

            <h2>Woodcarving Tradition</h2>
            <p>Nuristani woodcarving represents one of Asia's great artistic traditions. Carved wooden effigies of ancestors stood in cemeteries, while decorative panels adorned houses and temples. The elaborate carved columns, doors, and furniture display geometric and naturalistic motifs including horses, ibex, and human figures. Funerary statues (gandau) depicted the deceased seated on chairs. Collectors prize Nuristani carvings, though this has encouraged looting of historic pieces. Contemporary carvers maintain the tradition, producing works for local use and external markets.</p>

            <h2>War and Survival</h2>
            <p>Nuristan's remote valleys became battlegrounds during the Soviet-Afghan War, the Taliban period, and the post-2001 conflict. The fierce independence that allowed Nuristanis to resist Islamic conversion for centuries made them formidable fighters against all invaders. Villages were destroyed, populations displaced, and cultural heritage damaged. Despite these hardships, Nuristani communities maintain their distinct identity and languages. The region remains difficult to access, preserving some isolation that historically protected Nuristani culture while limiting development assistance.</p>
