            <h2>Who Are the Mon People?</h2>
            <p>The Mon are an Austroasiatic ethnic group of approximately 8 million people in Myanmar (primarily Mon State) and Thailand. They represent one of Southeast Asia's oldest civilizations—their Dvaravati and later Thaton kingdoms flourished before Thai and Burman dominance. The Mon brought Theravada Buddhism, writing systems, and urban culture to the region; Burmese and Thai scripts derive from Mon models. Despite this civilizational significance, Mon populations were absorbed by expanding Burman and Thai states. Today's Mon maintain distinctive identity while navigating minority status in both countries.</p>

            <h2>Civilizational Founders</h2>
            <p>The Mon were among Southeast Asia's first civilized peoples, establishing the Dvaravati kingdom (6th-11th centuries) in central Thailand and later powerful states in lower Burma. They transmitted Theravada Buddhism from India, developed sophisticated urban centers, and created scripts that Burmese, Thai, and others adapted. The Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon may have Mon origins. This civilizational role—as cultural teachers to later-dominant peoples—shapes Mon identity: a proud heritage of achievement preceding those who now govern them. Mon see themselves as originators, not mere minorities.</p>

            <h2>Absorption and Resistance</h2>
            <p>From the 16th century, Burman kingdoms progressively conquered and absorbed Mon populations. The final Mon kingdom fell in 1757; mass deportations, assimilation pressure, and migration followed. Many Mon fled to Thailand, where they gradually assimilated into Thai society while maintaining some distinct communities. In Myanmar, Mon identity persisted despite suppression; armed resistance began with the Mon National Liberation Army. Today, the New Mon State Party maintains ceasefire arrangements with Myanmar's government while pursuing political recognition. Mon nationalism emphasizes ancient civilization and continuing distinctiveness despite centuries of subordination.</p>

            <h2>Mon Language</h2>
            <p>The Mon language, part of the Austroasiatic family related to Khmer, has ancient literary traditions—some of the oldest writings in Southeast Asia are Mon inscriptions. During centuries of Burman dominance, Mon faced pressure toward Burmese; many became bilingual or shifted entirely. Today, perhaps 1-2 million speak Mon, primarily in Myanmar's Mon State. Schools in Mon areas now teach the language, and Mon literature is being revived. In Thailand, Mon communities have largely shifted to Thai while maintaining cultural practices. Language survival depends on community transmission amid dominant national languages.</p>

            <h2>Mon Buddhism</h2>
            <p>Buddhism is central to Mon identity—Mon communities introduced Theravada Buddhism to much of mainland Southeast Asia. Mon monks transmitted scriptures, built temples, and established the religious practices later adopted by Burmans and Thais. Distinctive Mon Buddhist traditions include specific ordination rituals, festival celebrations, and monastery architecture. The Mon New Year (held around April) involves elaborate Buddhist ceremonies, processions, and traditional entertainment. Through Buddhism, Mon maintain connections to their civilizational legacy even as political power has long since passed to others. Faith provides continuity across political transformations.</p>
