            <h2>Who Are the Lahu?</h2>
            <p>The Lahu (Lahuna, Musur) are a Tibeto-Burman ethnic group inhabiting mountainous regions of southern China, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam. Total population is approximately 900,000-1 million, with most in China's Yunnan Province where they have autonomous county status. They speak Lahu, a Loloish language. The name "Lahu" may derive from "La" (tiger) and "Hu" (to roast/hunt), reflecting their reputation as skilled hunters—particularly of tigers. The Lahu traditionally practiced swidden agriculture and hunting at elevations of 1,000-2,000 meters. Like other highland peoples of the region, they have been significantly affected by Christian missionary activity, and many Lahu are now Christian, particularly in Myanmar and Thailand.</p>

            <h2>Hunting Culture</h2>
            <p>The Lahu were renowned hunters, famous throughout the region for tracking and killing tigers, leopards, bears, and other dangerous game. Hunting skills were essential to male identity and status. Crossbows were the traditional weapon, crafted with great skill and used with poison-tipped arrows for large game. Hunting rituals invoked spirits for success and safety. The village would share meat from successful hunts according to prescribed rules. This hunting tradition reflected the Lahu relationship with the mountain forest—they saw themselves as forest people, distinct from valley-dwelling agriculturalists. As wildlife has declined and governments have restricted hunting, this tradition has largely ended, though crossbow competitions remain important in festivals and hunting stories are still told.</p>

            <h2>Religion and Messianism</h2>
            <p>Traditional Lahu religion centers on G'ui-sha, a supreme deity who created the world and humans. Lahu religious history includes remarkable messianic movements. Prophets emerged periodically claiming divine revelation, promising return of G'ui-sha or arrival of a messiah (often expected to come from the west with books and technology). These movements sometimes gathered thousands of followers, built temples, and challenged colonial and state authorities. This messianic tendency made the Lahu receptive to Christianity—missionaries arriving with books (the Bible) seemed to fulfill prophecies. American Baptist and other missionaries converted many Lahu in the 20th century. Today, Lahu religion is diverse: traditional animism, Christianity (Protestant and Catholic), Buddhism, and syncretic combinations exist across different communities and countries.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Lahu</h2>
            <p>Modern Lahu navigate between tradition and change across five countries. In China, Lancang Lahu Autonomous County provides political recognition, though development and tourism are transforming communities. Traditional dress—black with colorful trim and silver ornaments—remains important for festivals. In Myanmar, Lahu live in Shan State, affected by ongoing conflicts and opium economy (some Lahu areas were historically involved in cultivation). Thai Lahu face citizenship issues—many lack documentation despite generations of residence. Tourism to "hill tribe villages" brings income but raises exploitation concerns. The Lahu New Year (typically in February) brings communities together for dancing, singing, and the distinctive gourd-pipe music. Lahu-language radio broadcasts and literacy programs help maintain the language. The global Lahu diaspora, though smaller than some other highland peoples, maintains connections through churches and cultural organizations.</p>
