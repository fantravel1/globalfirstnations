            <h2>Who Are the Tahitian People?</h2>
            <p>The Tahitian people (Mā'ohi) are the indigenous Polynesians of French Polynesia, primarily inhabiting Tahiti and the surrounding Society Islands. Approximately 200,000 people of Mā'ohi ancestry live in French Polynesia, with additional populations in metropolitan France and elsewhere. Tahiti served as a major hub of ancient Polynesian voyaging, from which settlers departed for Hawaii, New Zealand, and other distant islands. French colonization from 1842 transformed Tahitian society, yet Mā'ohi identity persists through language, dance (particularly 'ori Tahiti), and ongoing movements for greater autonomy or independence.</p>

            <h2>'Ori Tahiti: The Dance</h2>
            <p>'Ori Tahiti (Tahitian dance) is one of the Pacific's most dynamic performance traditions, featuring rapid hip movements (tamure for women, aggressive stomping for men) and elaborate costumes of natural materials. Missionaries banned the dance as immoral, but it survived underground and revived in the 20th century. Today, 'ori Tahiti is taught worldwide, though practitioners debate authenticity and cultural appropriation. The annual Heiva festival in July features dance competition at the highest level, drawing competitors from throughout French Polynesia and beyond.</p>

            <h2>French Colonialism and Nuclear Testing</h2>
            <p>France colonized Tahiti in 1842 and made it a territory in 1880. The most traumatic colonial legacy was nuclear testing: France conducted 193 atmospheric and underground tests at Moruroa and Fangataufa atolls from 1966-1996. Long-denied health and environmental impacts are now acknowledged, with France establishing a compensation fund for affected individuals. The nuclear history galvanized independence movements and remains a sensitive issue. French Polynesia has autonomous status within France, with debates continuing over full independence.</p>

            <h2>Mā'ohi Renaissance</h2>
            <p>Since the 1970s, a cultural and political renaissance has strengthened Mā'ohi identity. Tahitian language, once suppressed in schools, is now taught and promoted. Artists, writers, and musicians create work exploring indigenous identity. Voyaging canoes have been built and sailed using traditional navigation techniques. The term Mā'ohi (indigenous Polynesian) has gained currency as an alternative to colonial identifications. This renaissance parallels Hawaiian and Māori movements, with Pacific indigenous peoples sharing experiences and strategies.</p>

            <h2>Gauguin's Legacy</h2>
            <p>Paul Gauguin famously painted Tahitian women, creating images that shaped global perceptions of Pacific paradise. Yet Gauguin's relationships with underage Tahitian girls, exoticization of Mā'ohi women, and colonial perspective have prompted re-evaluation. Contemporary Mā'ohi artists engage with and critique Gauguin's legacy, reclaiming representation of their culture. The tensions between tourism's "Tahitian paradise" marketing and lived Mā'ohi reality illustrate broader issues of indigenous representation in globally marketed cultures.</p>
