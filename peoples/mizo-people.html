            <h2>Who Are the Mizo?</h2>
            <p>The Mizo (meaning "highlanders") are a Tibeto-Burman people of northeastern India and adjacent Myanmar and Bangladesh, numbering approximately 1.5 million. The majority live in Mizoram state, where they constitute over 90% of the population. They speak Mizo (Lushai), a Tibeto-Burman language, with near-universal literacy. The Mizo are remarkable for their social homogeneity and egalitarian traditions, with no caste system and strong community cohesion. Christianity, introduced by Welsh missionaries in the late 19th century, is now practiced by over 90% of Mizo.</p>

            <h2>Egalitarian Society</h2>
            <p>Traditional Mizo society was remarkably egalitarian by South Asian standards. There was no caste system, land was communally owned, and cooperative labor (hnatlang) built houses and cleared fields. Chiefs (lal) led villages but power was checked by councils. The concept of tlawmngaihna—selfless service to others—remains a core Mizo value. This egalitarianism facilitated Christian conversion, which missionaries presented as compatible with existing values. The absence of rigid hierarchy distinguishes Mizo society from much of India and contributed to their strong ethnic identity.</p>

            <h2>Insurgency and Peace</h2>
            <p>The Mizo National Front (MNF) launched an insurgency in 1966 seeking independence from India, following government neglect during a devastating famine. Twenty years of conflict included Indian Air Force bombing of Aizawl, the only time independent India has bombed its own territory. The 1986 Mizo Accord brought peace, granting Mizoram statehood and integrating MNF leaders into politics. MNF leader Laldenga became chief minister. This transition from insurgency to peaceful politics represents one of India's most successful conflict resolutions, though it came after significant violence and displacement.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Mizo</h2>
            <p>Modern Mizoram is one of India's most peaceful and literate states, with near-universal literacy and strong educational institutions. The church plays central roles in social life. Development challenges include limited economic opportunities, reliance on central government funding, and geographic isolation. Young Mizos increasingly migrate to other Indian cities for education and employment. Mizo identity remains strong, but integration with broader India continues. How the Mizo balance their distinctive identity and Christian faith with Indian nationalism and economic development shapes this hill people's unique position in South Asia.</p>
