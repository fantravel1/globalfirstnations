            <h2>Who Are the Kani?</h2>
            <p>The Kani (also Kanikaran or Kanikar) are an indigenous tribal people of Kerala state in southwestern India, primarily inhabiting the forests of the southern Western Ghats in Thiruvananthapuram and Kollam districts. Numbering approximately 20,000-25,000, they are one of Kerala's largest tribal communities. The Kani speak a dialect of Tamil, though Malayalam is increasingly used. Their homeland includes some of India's most biodiverse tropical forests, including the Agasthyamalai Biosphere Reserve. The Kani are internationally known for the Jeevani case, a landmark benefit-sharing agreement regarding traditional medicinal knowledge, which established important precedents for indigenous intellectual property rights.</p>

            <h2>Traditional Medicine</h2>
            <p>The Kani possess extensive knowledge of medicinal plants from the Western Ghats' rich flora. Traditional healers (Plathis) use hundreds of plant species for various ailments, knowledge transmitted orally through generations. Among their remedies was Arogyapacha (Trichopus zeylanicus), used as an anti-fatigue herb by Kani guides working in the forest. When scientists from the Tropical Botanic Garden and Research Institute (TBGRI) developed Jeevani, a commercial product based on Arogyapacha, the Kani were recognized as knowledge holders. This led to a benefit-sharing agreement in which the Kani received license fees and royalties—one of the first such arrangements in India and an important precedent for indigenous intellectual property rights globally.</p>

            <h2>Jeevani Case</h2>
            <p>The Jeevani benefit-sharing agreement (1997) became a landmark case in indigenous knowledge rights. Scientists developed a commercial anti-fatigue drug based on Kani traditional knowledge; rather than appropriating this knowledge without compensation, TBGRI negotiated with Kani communities. The resulting agreement provided for license fees, royalties, and a Kerala Kani Samudaya Kshema Trust to manage community benefits. While implementation faced challenges—benefit distribution was uneven, and some questioned the consent process—the case established important principles. It demonstrated that traditional knowledge has commercial value deserving compensation and influenced subsequent Indian legislation on biological diversity and traditional knowledge protection.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Kani</h2>
            <p>Modern Kani face the challenges common to India's forest tribes: limited land rights, restricted forest access in protected areas, and poverty. Many Kani work as agricultural laborers on plantations that now cover much of their traditional territory. Some collect forest products for sale; others work as guides in ecotourism operations. Education has expanded, with Kani students accessing schools and some reaching higher education. The benefit-sharing trust provides some community resources, though management and distribution remain contentious. Political organization has grown; Kani leaders advocate for land rights, forest access, and development programs. The Kani demonstrate both the possibilities and limitations of traditional knowledge recognition as a path to indigenous empowerment.</p>
