            <h2>Who Are the Grebo?</h2>
            <p>The Grebo are a Kru ethnic group of southeastern Liberia and the adjacent border region of Côte d'Ivoire, numbering approximately 300,000-400,000. They speak several closely related Grebo languages of the Kru branch of Niger-Congo. The Grebo inhabit the forested coastal counties of Maryland, Grand Kru, and River Gee in Liberia. Like other Kru peoples, some Grebo worked as maritime laborers, though their territory was more remote from main shipping routes. The Grebo are particularly known for their distinctive mask traditions, producing dramatic face masks that have attracted international art collectors. The Grebo maintained fierce independence, resisting both Americo-Liberian authority and colonial expansion.</p>

            <h2>Distinctive Masks</h2>
            <p>Grebo masks rank among the most striking in African art. These face masks feature dramatically abstract designs: cylindrical projecting eyes, geometric patterns, and bold architectural forms that influenced early 20th-century European artists including Pablo Picasso. Masks served religious and social functions, appearing in rituals, funerals, and ceremonies conducted by the Bodio and other secret societies. Different mask types represented various spirits and served distinct purposes. The dramatic tubular eyes may represent spiritual vision. European collectors acquired Grebo masks from the late 19th century; today they appear in major art museums and command high prices. This artistic heritage represents significant African contributions to world art.</p>

            <h2>Maryland County History</h2>
            <p>Maryland County, the heart of Grebo territory, has a unique history. It was founded as the "Republic of Maryland," a separate colony established by the Maryland Colonization Society in 1834 for freed American slaves. This colony merged with Liberia in 1857, but the separate origin created distinct dynamics. The Grebo resisted Maryland colony expansion, fighting multiple wars with settlers in the 19th century. Harper, the county capital, developed as an administrative center. The Grebo maintained relative autonomy due to their remote location from Monrovia. This history of resistance and distance from the capital has shaped Grebo identity and their relationship with the Liberian state.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Grebo</h2>
            <p>Modern Grebo experienced Liberia's civil wars particularly intensely. Southeastern Liberia saw severe fighting, and many Grebo were displaced to refugee camps in Côte d'Ivoire or elsewhere. Some Grebo joined armed factions. Post-war recovery has been slow in the remote southeast, with limited infrastructure and economic opportunities. Rice farming, hunting, and fishing provide subsistence. Palm oil production offers cash income. Many educated Grebo have migrated to Monrovia. Traditional mask ceremonies continue, though the art market has altered their context. How the Grebo rebuild after civil conflict while maintaining their artistic heritage and forest-based livelihoods shapes this culturally significant people's future.</p>
