            <h2>Who Are the Pamunkey?</h2>
            <p>The Pamunkey are a Virginia Algonquian people and one of the founding tribes of the Powhatan Confederacy, which encountered the Jamestown colonists in 1607. Numbering approximately 200 enrolled members, they inhabit the Pamunkey Indian Reservation on the Pamunkey River in King William County, Virginia—one of the oldest reservations in the United States, established by a 1677 treaty and continuously occupied since. The Pamunkey speak English today, as the Virginia Algonquian language became extinct, though some vocabulary survives. They are descendants of Pocahontas's father, Chief Powhatan (Wahunsenacawh), who led the confederacy that the English encountered. In 2016, the Pamunkey became the first Virginia tribe to receive federal recognition, after decades of advocacy.</p>

            <h2>Powhatan Confederacy</h2>
            <p>The Pamunkey were the leading nation of the Powhatan Confederacy, which at contact comprised approximately 30 Algonquian-speaking tribes and perhaps 15,000-20,000 people across tidewater Virginia. Chief Powhatan (Wahunsenacawh) was Pamunkey; his daughter Matoaka (Pocahontas) married John Rolfe in 1614, temporarily easing relations. The confederacy was a paramount chiefdom: Powhatan exacted tribute from member tribes and appointed werowances (chiefs). This political organization initially allowed the Virginia Algonquians to manage English encroachment, but English expansion, particularly after tobacco cultivation proved profitable, led to wars (1610-14, 1622-32, 1644-46) that devastated the confederacy. By 1677, the remaining Virginia tribes signed treaties that established small reservations—fragments of their former territory.</p>

            <h2>Survival in Virginia</h2>
            <p>The Pamunkey survived where most Virginia Algonquians did not, maintaining continuous presence on their reservation for over 340 years. This survival required navigating Virginia's racial hierarchy. The 1924 Racial Integrity Act classified Virginians as either "white" or "colored," erasing indigenous identity; the Pamunkey fought to maintain their distinct status. Walter Plecker, Virginia's registrar of vital statistics, attempted to reclassify Indians as "colored," destroying birth records and denying indigenous existence. The Pamunkey and other Virginia tribes maintained identity through endogamy, tribal governance, and cultural practices, despite official erasure. Pottery making, fishing (particularly shad), and traditional crafts continued. The annual tribute of fish and game to Virginia's governor, established by the 1677 treaty, continues ceremonially today.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Pamunkey</h2>
            <p>Modern Pamunkey achieved federal recognition in 2016 after a decades-long process—Virginia tribes faced unique obstacles because historical records were destroyed by Plecker. Federal recognition brought access to services and programs, and confirmed government-to-government relationship. The Pamunkey Indian Museum on the reservation interprets tribal history. The reservation's location on the river maintains connection to traditional fishing; annual shad harvests continue. The tribe is exploring economic development including potential gaming, though this is controversial both within the tribe and with neighboring communities. Some Pamunkey have intermarried with African Americans, raising questions about tribal identity and membership that echo broader debates about indigeneity in the eastern United States. The Pamunkey represent the persistence of Virginia Algonquian identity despite four centuries of colonization, displacement, and official erasure.</p>
