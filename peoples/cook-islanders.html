            <h2>Who Are Cook Islanders?</h2>
            <p>Cook Islanders are the indigenous Polynesian people of the Cook Islands—15 islands spread across 2 million square kilometers of South Pacific Ocean. Approximately 15,000 live in the Cook Islands, while over 80,000 live in New Zealand (where they hold automatic citizenship) and Australia. They speak Cook Islands Māori (Rarotongan), a Polynesian language closely related to New Zealand Māori and Tahitian. The Cook Islands are self-governing in free association with New Zealand, maintaining their own government while New Zealand handles defense and some foreign affairs. Cook Islanders have preserved vibrant cultural traditions including some of Polynesia's most spectacular dance and drumming.</p>

            <h2>Dance and Drumming</h2>
            <p>Cook Islands dance ('ura) is among Polynesia's most dynamic—fast hip movements, energetic drumming, and elaborate costumes distinguish it from other Polynesian styles. The annual Te Maeva Nui festival (celebrating Constitution Day) features competitive dance performances from each island. Dancers wear grass skirts, flower headdresses, and shell ornaments; drumming provides driving rhythms. The tradition nearly died under missionary suppression but was revived in the 20th century, becoming central to Cook Islands identity. Contemporary dance groups perform internationally, representing Cook Islands culture abroad. The art form requires years of training and is a source of intense community pride.</p>

            <h2>Free Association</h2>
            <p>Since 1965, the Cook Islands have been self-governing in free association with New Zealand—a unique political status. The Cook Islands have their own parliament, prime minister, and laws; they control immigration, taxation, and most domestic policy. New Zealand provides defense, and Cook Islanders are New Zealand citizens, able to live and work there freely. This arrangement has been stable but creates challenges: most Cook Islanders have emigrated to New Zealand for economic opportunities, leaving a shrinking population managing a vast maritime territory. The Cook Islands are sometimes called "the world's first example" of free association.</p>

            <h2>Emigration Challenge</h2>
            <p>More Cook Islanders live abroad than at home—a demographic pattern shared with few other nations. The population in the islands declined from about 21,000 in 1971 to under 15,000 today, while the New Zealand community grew. This emigration drains skilled workers, challenges services, and threatens cultural transmission (though diaspora communities maintain strong identity). The resident population is aging; schools consolidate. Yet some Cook Islanders return, and the islands' beauty attracts investment. How the Cook Islands maintain cultural identity, governance capacity, and economic viability with a small, declining resident population defines their unique challenge.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Cook Islands</h2>
            <p>Modern Cook Islands balance tourism-dependent economy with cultural preservation. The islands are a popular tourist destination; resorts, especially on Rarotonga and Aitutaki, drive the economy. Traditional culture is both authentic practice and tourist product—raising questions about commodification. Marine resources (the Cook Islands' exclusive economic zone is vast) offer potential through seabed mining, though environmental concerns exist. Climate change threatens low-lying atolls. The close New Zealand relationship provides security but also dependency. How Cook Islanders navigate small-nation challenges while maintaining Polynesian identity across a scattered population—home and diaspora—shapes their future.</p>
