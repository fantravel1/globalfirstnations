            <h2>Who Are the Romani?</h2>
            <p>The Romani (Roma, Romany—often pejoratively called "Gypsies") are an Indo-Aryan ethnic group originating from the Indian subcontinent who migrated to Europe beginning around the 11th century. Total population is approximately 10-12 million, making them Europe's largest ethnic minority. The largest populations are in Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Slovakia, and Spain (Gitanos). They speak Romani, an Indo-Aryan language with Sanskrit roots, though many Romani now speak only the languages of their host countries. The Romani have faced centuries of persecution, including enslavement in Romania until 1856, the Nazi genocide (Porajmos) that killed 500,000+, and ongoing discrimination. Despite statelessness and dispersal, they have maintained distinct identity across Europe for over 1,000 years.</p>

            <h2>Origins and History</h2>
            <p>Linguistic and genetic evidence traces Romani origins to northwestern India (Rajasthan region), with migration westward beginning around 1000 CE. The Romani language retains Sanskrit-derived vocabulary and grammar. Groups reached Europe by the 14th century, initially received as exotic visitors, then marginalized. In Romania and Moldova, Romani were enslaved (robi) for centuries—property of nobles, monasteries, and the state—until abolition in 1856. Elsewhere, laws banned Romani presence, punished their language and customs, and deported them. Despite persecution, Romani developed niches: metalworking, horse trading, entertainment, fortune-telling. The Nazi genocide killed an estimated 500,000-1,500,000 Romani across Europe—the Porajmos ("Devouring") was proportionally devastating as the Jewish Holocaust but received far less recognition until recently.</p>

            <h2>Culture and Diversity</h2>
            <p>Romani culture is diverse across Europe, shaped by centuries in different countries. Common elements include emphasis on family and community (often organized by clans), concepts of ritual purity (marime) governing behavior, and the distinction between Romani (insiders) and gadje (outsiders). Music is central—Romani musicians profoundly influenced European music, from flamenco in Spain to Hungarian folk to Balkan brass. Django Reinhardt, the jazz guitarist, was Romani. Traditional occupations varied by region; many Romani now work in all sectors. The Romani flag (blue and green with red wheel) symbolizes transnational identity. Evangelical Christianity has grown significantly among Romani in recent decades. Romani diversity includes the Sinti (Germany/Central Europe), Gitanos (Spain), Romanichal (Britain), and many others with distinct dialects and customs.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Romani</h2>
            <p>Modern Romani remain Europe's most marginalized ethnic group. Discrimination in education, employment, and housing is documented across Europe; Roma unemployment rates are many times higher than national averages. Romani settlements often lack basic infrastructure. Anti-Roma sentiment is openly expressed by politicians in ways unacceptable regarding other minorities. In Eastern Europe, segregated schools, forced evictions, and hate crimes persist. Western European countries have expelled Roma migrants. Yet Romani activism has grown—organizations advocate for rights, education, and political representation. The European Roma Rights Centre documents discrimination. International Romani Day (April 8) marks growing transnational consciousness. Some countries have begun Holocaust recognition and reparations. The EU has Romani inclusion strategies, though implementation lags. The Romani experience represents both the persistence of Europe's oldest diaspora and the continent's failure to fully realize minority rights.</p>
