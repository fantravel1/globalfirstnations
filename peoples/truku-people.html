            <h2>Who Are the Truku?</h2>
            <p>The Truku (Taroko) are an indigenous Austronesian people of Taiwan, inhabiting the mountainous regions of Hualien and Nantou counties, including the spectacular Taroko Gorge—one of Taiwan's premier natural attractions. Numbering approximately 30,000-32,000, they speak Truku, an Atayalic language closely related to Seediq and Atayal. Previously classified as a subgroup of Atayal, the Truku achieved recognition as Taiwan's 12th official indigenous group in 2004. Their homeland encompasses some of Taiwan's most dramatic mountain scenery; the Truku Gorge (Taroko National Park) draws millions of visitors annually, placing Truku communities at the intersection of conservation, tourism, and indigenous rights.</p>

            <h2>Mountain Warriors</h2>
            <p>Traditional Truku culture was shaped by life in Taiwan's precipitous central mountains. Villages perched on ridges and slopes; terraced fields grew millet and sweet potato; hunting supplied protein. The Truku practiced headhunting as part of the broader Atayalic cultural complex—taking enemy heads demonstrated male prowess and was connected to spiritual beliefs about passage to the afterlife. Facial tattoos (ptasan) marked adult achievement: men earned tattoos through headhunting; women through accomplished weaving. Japanese colonial campaigns (1914-1930s) suppressed headhunting and displaced communities; the Truku's resistance to Japanese pacification—including the related Seediq in the Wushe Incident (1930)—has become a symbol of indigenous resistance in Taiwanese memory.</p>

            <h2>Taroko National Park</h2>
            <p>Taroko National Park, established in 1986, encompasses much of the traditional Truku homeland. The gorge—a dramatic marble canyon carved through the mountains—is Taiwan's most famous natural landmark. Millions of tourists visit annually; the Cross-Island Highway (Central Cross-Island Highway) runs through the gorge. This popularity has created both opportunity and tension. Truku communities have been incorporated into tourism—cultural villages, guided tours, handicraft sales—providing income. However, the park restricts traditional hunting and land use; disputes over indigenous rights within the park continue. Some Truku advocate for greater control over park management and tourism revenue; others worry about commercialization of culture. Taroko represents the complex intersection of indigenous homeland, conservation, and mass tourism.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Truku</h2>
            <p>Modern Truku communities span the mountains and eastern coastal plain. Many have relocated from high-altitude villages to more accessible locations, though connections to ancestral areas remain. Christianity (primarily Presbyterian and Catholic) has become widespread, replacing traditional beliefs for most families. The Truku language is healthier than many Taiwan indigenous languages, spoken across generations in core areas. Traditional weaving has been revived; Truku textiles are recognized for distinctive geometric patterns. Recognition as a distinct indigenous group (separate from Atayal) in 2004 affirmed Truku identity and provided institutional support. Young Truku navigate between traditional knowledge—still transmitted in many families—and modern education and careers. The Truku demonstrate how indigenous peoples whose homelands become national parks must assert rights while engaging with the conservation and tourism systems that now shape their territories.</p>
