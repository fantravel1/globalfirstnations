            <h2>Who Are the Pueblo Peoples?</h2>
            <p>The Pueblo peoples are 21 distinct Native American nations of New Mexico and Arizona, numbering approximately 60,000. "Pueblo" (Spanish for "village") describes their distinctive multi-story adobe and stone architecture. They speak four unrelated language families: Tanoan (Tewa, Tiwa, Towa), Keresan, Zuni (a language isolate), and Hopi (Uto-Aztecan). Despite linguistic diversity, Pueblo peoples share cultural elements: settled agricultural life, kiva ceremonies, clan organization, and spiritual traditions emphasizing harmony and balance. Descendants of ancient Ancestral Puebloans (Anasazi), they have continuously inhabited the Southwest for over 1,000 years—the oldest continuously occupied settlements in North America.</p>

            <h2>Ancient Roots</h2>
            <p>Pueblo peoples descend from Ancestral Puebloans who built Mesa Verde, Chaco Canyon, and countless other sites. Environmental change and social factors led to migration to present locations by 1300 CE. The Rio Grande Pueblos (most New Mexico pueblos) developed along the river; western pueblos (Acoma, Zuni, Hopi) occupied mesa tops and valleys. Each pueblo developed distinct character while sharing agricultural economy (corn, beans, squash), ceremonial practice (kiva societies, seasonal dances), and architectural tradition. Multi-story adobe buildings, often built around plazas, could house hundreds of people in communal structures.</p>

            <h2>Pueblo Revolt</h2>
            <p>Spanish colonization (1598) brought missions, forced labor (encomienda), and religious suppression. In 1680, the Pueblo peoples achieved what no other Native American group accomplished: they successfully expelled European colonizers. Led by Popé of San Juan Pueblo, the Pueblo Revolt killed 400 Spanish and drove remaining colonists to El Paso. Pueblos remained independent for 12 years until Spanish reconquest (1692). This revolt—unprecedented in its coordination across different language groups—demonstrated Pueblo determination to maintain their religion. Post-reconquest, Spanish rule was less harsh; Pueblo religious practice continued, often beneath Catholic overlay.</p>

            <h2>Survival Strategy</h2>
            <p>Pueblo survival strategy differed from nomadic peoples: rather than flee or fight prolonged wars, Pueblos accommodated Spanish, then Mexican, then American rule while maintaining core cultural practices. Catholicism was adopted but integrated with traditional religion; Spanish-introduced crops and animals were incorporated. This apparent accommodation masked tenacious preservation of language, ceremony, and identity. Each pueblo maintained autonomy; there was no unified Pueblo government. The result: unlike many tribes, Pueblo peoples retained their original homelands, maintained languages and ceremonies, and survived as distinct communities.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Pueblos</h2>
            <p>Modern Pueblo nations maintain remarkable cultural continuity. Religious ceremonies—largely closed to outsiders—continue in underground kivas. Each pueblo governs itself through traditional councils (often alongside federally-recognized governments). Languages range from healthy (Zuni, Keresan) to endangered. Distinctive pottery, jewelry, and other arts continue and thrive economically. Some pueblos have developed gaming; others maintain traditional economies. Taos Pueblo's multi-story adobe structures are UNESCO World Heritage Site. Water rights, sacred site protection, and cultural privacy remain concerns. How Pueblo peoples balance openness and privacy, development and tradition, shapes these ancient communities' futures.</p>
