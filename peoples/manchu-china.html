            <h2>Who Are the Manchu?</h2>
            <p>The Manchu are a Tungusic people from Manchuria (northeastern China) who conquered China and established the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912), ruling for nearly three centuries. Today, approximately 10 million people identify as Manchu, making them China's fourth-largest minority. However, the Manchu language is critically endangered—perhaps fewer than 100 elderly native speakers remain—and cultural distinctiveness has largely faded through centuries of assimilation with Han Chinese. The Manchu represent a paradox: a people who ruled China but lost their language and culture in the process of governing it.</p>

            <h2>Rise and Fall</h2>
            <p>The Manchu originated as Jurchen tribes in the forests and plains of Manchuria. Nurhaci unified them in the early 17th century, creating the Eight Banners military-administrative system. His successors conquered Ming China, establishing Qing rule. The Manchu maintained distinctions initially—their own language, bannerman status, marriage restrictions—but gradually sinified over generations. By the late Qing, most Manchu spoke only Chinese. The 1911 revolution overthrew the dynasty amid anti-Manchu sentiment; many Manchu hid their identity during decades of discrimination. Only after 1949 did Manchu identity become safe to acknowledge.</p>

            <h2>Language Extinction</h2>
            <p>Manchu was once an imperial language with vast bureaucratic documentation—Qing archives contain millions of Manchu documents invaluable for historical research. Yet the language is now nearly extinct. By 1900, most Manchu had shifted to Chinese; the twentieth century's disruptions further eroded transmission. Today, perhaps 10-20 elderly speakers remain in scattered villages. Revival efforts include university programs and cultural associations, but restoration seems unlikely—the language lost its community of speakers too completely. This extreme case of language death amid population survival illustrates how political dominance doesn't guarantee linguistic survival.</p>

            <h2>Cultural Legacy</h2>
            <p>Despite language loss, Manchu cultural contributions persist in Chinese society. The qipao (cheongsam) dress derives from Manchu garments. Beijing cuisine includes Manchu dishes. Shamanic traditions influenced northern Chinese religion. Place names across Manchuria preserve Manchu words. Most significantly, Qing-era architecture, art, and imperial traditions—visible in the Forbidden City and summer palaces—represent Manchu aesthetic sensibilities merged with Chinese traditions. This cultural fusion, rather than distinct Manchu tradition, became the legacy of three centuries of rule.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Identity</h2>
            <p>Modern Manchu identity is primarily genealogical rather than cultural—people identify as Manchu based on ancestry, not language or distinctive practices. Minority status provides some benefits (relaxed family planning policies), encouraging registration. Some Manchu engage in cultural revival—learning the script, practicing shamanic rituals, researching family histories. Websites and associations connect the dispersed community. Yet most Manchu are culturally indistinguishable from Han Chinese neighbors. The Manchu case raises questions about ethnic identity's basis when distinctive culture has largely vanished.</p>
