            <h2>Who Are the Uzbeks?</h2>
            <p>The Uzbeks are a Turkic people numbering approximately 35 million—27 million in Uzbekistan (Central Asia's most populous country), with significant minorities in Afghanistan (3 million), Tajikistan (1.2 million), Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and elsewhere. They speak Uzbek, a Karluk Turkic language written in Latin script (formerly Cyrillic, Arabic). Uzbeks emerged as distinct group in the 15th-16th centuries, inheriting the great Silk Road cities—Samarkand, Bukhara, Khiva—that were centers of Islamic civilization. Their territory encompasses Central Asia's agricultural heartland and some of humanity's most spectacular Islamic architecture.</p>

            <h2>Silk Road Civilization</h2>
            <p>Uzbekistan's territory hosted some of history's greatest civilizations. Samarkand, Bukhara, and Khiva were Silk Road jewels where East met West. Alexander the Great conquered here; the region was Persian, then Arab (bringing Islam), then Turkic. Timur (Tamerlane, 1336-1405) built an empire from Samarkand, leaving architectural masterpieces—Registan, Bibi-Khanym Mosque, Gur-e-Amir. His descendant Babur founded India's Mughal Empire. The Uzbek Khanate emerged in the 16th century. Bukhara became renowned Islamic learning center; the region produced scholars like al-Bukhari, Avicenna, al-Biruni. This heritage—Persian-Turkic Islamic synthesis—defines Uzbek cultural identity.</p>

            <h2>Russian and Soviet Era</h2>
            <p>Russian conquest (1860s-1870s) brought colonial rule. The Soviets (1924) created Uzbekistan, deliberately separating Tajiks from related Uzbeks. Cotton monoculture transformed agriculture; the Aral Sea's destruction for irrigation became ecological catastrophe. Soviet modernization brought literacy and industry but also repression—Islamic institutions closed, intellectuals purged. Cotton quotas amounted to forced labor. Islam Karimov, Communist leader, became independent Uzbekistan's authoritarian president (1991-2016). The Andijan massacre (2005) killed hundreds of protesters. Recent successor Shavkat Mirziyoyev has implemented reforms while maintaining authoritarian control.</p>

            <h2>Culture and Traditions</h2>
            <p>Uzbek culture blends Turkic and Persian influences. Cuisine features plov (pilaf, national dish), samsa, shashlik, and distinctive breads (non). Silk weaving (ikat), ceramics, and metalwork continue traditional crafts. Music features dutar and doira; maqom classical tradition is UNESCO-listed. Architecture—blue-tiled mosques, madrasas, mausoleums—attracts global tourists. Islam shapes identity; Sufism historically influenced spirituality. The mahalla (neighborhood) remains social organization's basis. Uzbek hospitality is legendary. These traditions survived Soviet secularization and continue in modernizing society.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Uzbekistan</h2>
            <p>Modern Uzbekistan is Central Asia's most populous nation, strategically located, and opening after Karimov's isolation. Tourism booms at Silk Road sites; economic reforms attract investment. Yet challenges persist: authoritarian governance, limited press freedom, corruption, and the Aral Sea disaster's legacy. Cotton forced labor has diminished but monitoring continues. Afghan border brings security concerns. Uzbeks in Afghanistan face Taliban rule. How Uzbekistan balances reform with stability, heritage tourism with modernization, and regional influence with great power relations shapes this Silk Road people's future in their historic homeland.</p>
