            <h2>Who Are the Mishing?</h2>
            <p>The Mishing (also known as Miri) are a Tibeto-Burman indigenous people of Assam, India, numbering approximately 700,000-800,000 people. They speak Mishing, a Tani language closely related to Adi and other languages of Arunachal Pradesh. The Mishing are the second-largest Scheduled Tribe in Assam. Originally highland dwellers who migrated from Arunachal Pradesh, they adapted to life along the Brahmaputra River and its tributaries, developing distinctive stilt-house architecture (chang ghar) suited to flood-prone riverine environments. The Mishing are known for their weaving traditions, rice beer (apong), and the vibrant Ali-Aye-Ligang spring festival.</p>

            <h2>Chang Ghar Architecture</h2>
            <p>The Mishing are famous for their chang ghar—houses built on stilts or raised platforms. This architecture is an adaptation to life on the Brahmaputra floodplains, where annual flooding makes ground-level construction impractical. Chang ghars elevate living spaces above flood waters, with the space below used for livestock, storage, and daily activities during dry seasons. Houses are built from bamboo and timber, with thatched roofs. The design allows air circulation in the humid climate. Extended families often share connected structures. Chang ghar construction demonstrates the Mishing's successful adaptation from highland origins to riverine environments.</p>

            <h2>Ali-Aye-Ligang Festival</h2>
            <p>Ali-Aye-Ligang is the most important Mishing festival, celebrated in mid-February to mark the beginning of the agricultural season (ahu paddy sowing). The name combines "Ali" (seeds), "Aye" (fruits), and "Ligang" (to sow). During the festival, communities perform the Gumrag dance, where men and women dance in lines mimicking agricultural activities. Apong (rice beer) flows freely, and traditional foods are prepared. The festival reinforces community bonds, celebrates agricultural heritage, and connects Mishing to their riverine ecosystem. Ali-Aye-Ligang has gained recognition beyond Mishing communities as a symbol of Assamese cultural diversity.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Mishing</h2>
            <p>Modern Mishing face challenges from the Brahmaputra's increasingly severe floods, exacerbated by climate change, which annually displace thousands. Many Mishing have lost agricultural land to river erosion. Despite Scheduled Tribe status, development has been uneven. The Mishing Autonomous Council provides some self-governance. Traditional weaving, particularly the distinctive mirí-jim fabric, continues as both cultural practice and livelihood. The Mishing language faces pressure from Assamese, though efforts at script development and education continue. Mishing political organizations advocate for land rights and flood protection. How the Mishing navigate environmental challenges while maintaining their river-adapted culture shapes their future in changing times.</p>
