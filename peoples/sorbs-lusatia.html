            <h2>Who Are the Sorbs?</h2>
            <p>The Sorbs (also called Wends or Lusatians) are a Western Slavic people indigenous to Lusatia, a region now divided between the German states of Saxony and Brandenburg. Numbering approximately 60,000, they are Germany's only indigenous ethnic minority with their own language, culture, and protected legal status. Their ancestors settled the region over 1,400 years ago.</p>
            <p>Once part of a much larger Slavic population extending to the Elbe River, the Sorbs survived centuries of Germanization that assimilated neighboring Slavic peoples. Their persistence represents a remarkable example of minority survival in the heart of Europe, maintaining distinct identity despite political changes from medieval kingdoms through Nazi persecution to East German recognition.</p>

            </div>

            <h2>Two Languages, One People</h2>
            <p>The Sorbs speak two distinct languages: Upper Sorbian (Hornjoserbšćina) centered around Bautzen in Saxony, and Lower Sorbian (Dolnoserbšćina) around Cottbus in Brandenburg. While related, the languages are not mutually intelligible. Upper Sorbian remains relatively healthy with about 20,000 speakers; Lower Sorbian is critically endangered with perhaps 7,000 speakers, mostly elderly.</p>
            <p>Both languages have official recognition in their respective regions, with bilingual signage, Sorbian-medium schools, and public media. The Sorbian Institute in Bautzen conducts linguistic and cultural research. Despite these supports, language shift to German continues, and the future of both languages—especially Lower Sorbian—remains uncertain.</p>

            <h2>Easter Egg Art</h2>
            <p>The Sorbs are famous throughout Germany for their elaborate Easter egg decoration, using wax-resist dyeing techniques to create intricate geometric and floral patterns. Each region has characteristic designs, and the most skilled artists produce eggs of remarkable beauty. The tradition has become an important marker of Sorbian identity and source of tourism revenue.</p>
            <p>Easter itself features distinctive Sorbian customs including the Osterreiten (Easter Riding), where men in formal dress ride decorated horses between parishes announcing Christ's resurrection. This tradition, combining Catholic liturgy with folk celebration, draws thousands of spectators annually and has been recognized by UNESCO as an important cultural practice.</p>

            <h2>History of Survival</h2>
            <p>The Sorbs survived by rural isolation, cultural resilience, and occasional political protection. The Reformation divided them between Catholics (Upper Sorbs) and Lutherans (Lower Sorbs), but both maintained Slavic identity. Prussian and later German policies fluctuated between tolerance and suppression.</p>
            <p>The Nazi period brought severe persecution—Sorbian organizations were banned, language use restricted, and some activists imprisoned or killed. Post-war East Germany recognized the Sorbs as a protected minority, establishing cultural institutions that continue today. Reunified Germany maintained these protections, and the Sorbs enjoy stronger rights than most European minorities.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Challenges</h2>
            <p>Coal mining has physically destroyed numerous Sorbian villages, as Lusatia contains Germany's largest lignite deposits. Entire communities were forcibly relocated, and the cultural landscape was transformed. As coal mining winds down, economic challenges have prompted young people to leave for cities, accelerating demographic decline.</p>
            <p>Sorbian institutions work to attract young people back and maintain cultural vitality. The Witaj program provides Sorbian-language education from preschool, aiming to create new speakers. Annual festivals celebrate heritage, and Sorbian music has experienced revival. Whether these efforts can reverse language shift remains uncertain, but Sorbian identity shows continued vitality.</p>
