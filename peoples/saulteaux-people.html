            <h2>Who Are the Saulteaux?</h2>
            <p>The Saulteaux (also called Plains Ojibwe or Nakawē) are an Anishinaabe people inhabiting the prairies and parklands of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and adjacent areas. Numbering approximately 50,000-60,000, they are part of the broader Ojibwe/Anishinaabe nation but developed distinct cultural adaptations to prairie and parkland environments. The name "Saulteaux" derives from French "Saulteurs" (people of the rapids/Sault Ste. Marie), their earlier homeland before westward migration. They speak Saulteaux (Nakawēwin), a dialect of Ojibwe. The Saulteaux moved westward during the 18th and 19th centuries, adapting from Great Lakes woodland culture to incorporate elements of plains life, including bison hunting and tipi dwelling while maintaining Anishinaabe spiritual traditions.</p>

            <h2>Westward Migration</h2>
            <p>The Saulteaux ancestors lived around Sault Ste. Marie and the western Great Lakes before moving westward beginning in the 1700s. This expansion was driven by the fur trade—as Ojibwe pushed west to access new trapping territories, they displaced previous inhabitants. By the early 19th century, Saulteaux bands had reached the Saskatchewan prairies. This migration transformed culture: Saulteaux adopted plains elements including bison hunting (using horses acquired from southern tribes), tipi dwelling, and some aspects of plains ceremonialism, while maintaining Anishinaabe language, clan system, and spiritual practices like the Midewiwin lodge. The Saulteaux became a bridge people, connecting woodland and plains cultures, fluent in both worlds.</p>

            <h2>Treaties and Reserves</h2>
            <p>The Saulteaux signed several of the numbered treaties with Canada: Treaty 1 (1871), Treaty 2 (1871), Treaty 4 (1874), Treaty 5 (1875), Treaty 6 (1876), and others. These treaties ceded vast territories in exchange for reserves, annuities, and promises of assistance. As with other First Nations, treaty promises were frequently broken. The Saulteaux were confined to reserves; bison disappeared; traditional economy collapsed. The pass system restricted movement; children were taken to residential schools. Despite these devastations, Saulteaux communities survived. Today, Saulteaux First Nations in Manitoba and Saskatchewan include Peguis First Nation, Sandy Bay First Nation, and many others. These communities continue to assert treaty rights and pursue land claims.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Saulteaux</h2>
            <p>Modern Saulteaux face challenges common to prairie First Nations: reserve poverty, inadequate housing, health disparities, and the ongoing trauma of residential schools and child welfare removals. However, Saulteaux communities are also sites of cultural revitalization. The Midewiwin (Grand Medicine Society) continues; powwows and traditional ceremonies flourish. The Saulteaux language is endangered but transmission efforts exist. Treaty rights remain central to Saulteaux politics; disputes over unfulfilled treaty promises continue. Some Saulteaux First Nations have successfully pursued economic development including gaming, resource extraction revenue sharing, and other enterprises. The Peguis First Nation, one of the largest in Manitoba, has been particularly active in asserting rights and pursuing development. The Saulteaux demonstrate how Anishinaabe peoples adapted to new environments while maintaining core cultural identity.</p>
