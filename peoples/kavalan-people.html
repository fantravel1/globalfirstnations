            <h2>Who Are the Kavalan?</h2>
            <p>The Kavalan (Kebalan, Kbalan) are an indigenous Austronesian people of Taiwan, historically inhabiting the Yilan Plain (Kavalan Plain) on Taiwan's northeastern coast. Numbering approximately 1,500-2,000 officially registered, they speak Kavalan, a critically endangered Austronesian language. The Kavalan were one of Taiwan's "plains indigenous peoples" (Pingpu), who experienced intensive Chinese colonization beginning in the Qing dynasty (19th century), leading to severe cultural erosion. After over a century of official non-recognition, the Kavalan achieved recognition as Taiwan's 11th official indigenous group in 2002, representing a significant victory for plains indigenous rights.</p>

            <h2>Displacement History</h2>
            <p>The Kavalan originally inhabited the fertile Yilan Plain, which attracted intensive Chinese (Han) settlement during the Qing dynasty. Unlike mountain indigenous peoples who could retreat to highlands, the Kavalan's lowland territory was rapidly colonized. By the mid-19th century, massive Chinese immigration had displaced most Kavalan; many migrated southward to the Hualien area seeking refuge. This displacement disrupted traditional village organization, religious practices, and language transmission. Under Japanese colonial rule and subsequent Chinese Nationalist (KMT) government, the Kavalan—like other plains peoples—were classified as assimilated "Han" rather than indigenous, denying them recognition and protections available to mountain tribes.</p>

            <h2>Recognition Struggle</h2>
            <p>The Kavalan's struggle for official recognition exemplifies the broader Pingpu (plains indigenous) movement. Despite maintaining distinct identity, language fragments, and cultural practices, the Kavalan were denied indigenous status because colonial policies classified them as "assimilated." Beginning in the 1980s-1990s, Kavalan activists collected genealogies, documented remaining cultural practices, and lobbied government. The Kisaiz ritual (ancestor veneration ceremony featuring banana-leaf offerings and distinctive songs) was revived and promoted as evidence of distinct identity. In 2002, Taiwan recognized the Kavalan as the 11th official indigenous people—the first plains group to achieve recognition. This victory opened possibilities for other Pingpu groups, though most remain unrecognized.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Kavalan</h2>
            <p>Modern Kavalan communities are concentrated in Hualien County (particularly Xinsheng Township) and scattered in Yilan. Recognition has provided benefits: indigenous health insurance, education subsidies, and cultural support funds. However, challenges remain severe. The Kavalan language has perhaps 100 elderly speakers remaining; extinction appears likely without dramatic intervention. Cultural knowledge was extensively lost during the non-recognition period. Young Kavalan, often products of mixed marriages, must consciously choose to identify and learn. Cultural revival efforts include language classes, ritual revitalization, and cultural tourism. The Kavalan represent both the damage that non-recognition inflicts on indigenous peoples and the possibilities of reclaiming identity even after generations of official denial.</p>
