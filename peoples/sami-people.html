            <h2>Who Are the Sami?</h2>
            <p>The Sami (also Saami, formerly "Lapps"—considered derogatory) are the indigenous people of Sápmi, the Arctic region spanning northern Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia's Kola Peninsula. They number approximately 80,000-100,000—50,000-65,000 in Norway, 20,000-40,000 in Sweden, 10,000 in Finland, and 2,000 in Russia. They speak several Sami languages (Uralic family, related to Finnish), though many now speak only majority languages. The Sami are Europe's only officially recognized indigenous people, historically known for reindeer herding, distinctive dress (gákti), and joik singing. Their culture survived centuries of assimilation pressure and is experiencing revival.</p>

            <h2>Ancient Inhabitants</h2>
            <p>Sami ancestors inhabited Scandinavia for at least 10,000 years—among Europe's oldest continuous populations. They developed sustainable Arctic lifestyle: fishing, hunting, gathering, and later reindeer herding (perhaps 400-500 years ago in current form). Traditional Sami religion involved shamanism, nature spirits, and sacred sites (sieidi); drums enabled spirit communication. Norwegian, Swedish, and Russian expansion (medieval period onward) pushed Sami northward. Colonial-era taxation, forced Christianization, and border impositions divided the once-unified Sami territory. The reindeer-herding minority became stereotypical while coastal and forest Sami were often forgotten.</p>

            <h2>Assimilation Era</h2>
            <p>The 19th-20th centuries brought severe assimilation policies. Sami languages were banned in schools; children were sent to boarding schools far from families. "Norwegianization," "Swedification" policies aimed to eliminate Sami culture. Scientific racism (skull measurements, forced sterilization) targeted Sami. Traditional lands were appropriated for farming, hydropower, mining. Many Sami hid their identity; language transmission broke. The joik (traditional singing) was banned as "devil's work." This cultural genocide—now acknowledged by Scandinavian governments—devastated communities. Yet enough Sami maintained culture in remote areas to enable later revival.</p>

            <h2>Revival and Rights</h2>
            <p>The 1970s-80s brought Sami awakening. The Alta controversy (Norwegian dam project opposed by Sami, 1979-1981) galvanized activism. Norway, Sweden, and Finland established Sami Parliaments (advisory bodies) in 1989, 1993, and 1996. ILO Convention 169 (indigenous rights) was ratified by Norway. Sami languages gained official status; cultural institutions developed. Reindeer herding receives legal protection, though conflicts with mining, wind farms, and predator policy continue. The 2021 Fosen wind farm verdict (Norwegian Supreme Court) ruled construction violated Sami rights—enforcement remains contested. Recognition advances but land rights disputes persist.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Sami</h2>
            <p>Modern Sami navigate between traditional livelihood (10% still herd reindeer) and contemporary life. Most live in towns; many have assimilated. Language revitalization efforts show mixed success—some dialects recover, others remain critically endangered. The distinctive gákti (dress) is worn at celebrations; joik is performed publicly. Sami artists, musicians, and filmmakers gain international attention. Climate change threatens reindeer herding through ice conditions, pasture changes. Mining and wind energy projects continue to conflict with traditional lands. How Sami maintain culture, achieve genuine self-determination, and adapt to Arctic changes shapes Europe's only indigenous people's future.</p>
