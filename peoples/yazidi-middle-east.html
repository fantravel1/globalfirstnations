            <h2>Who Are the Yazidis?</h2>
            <p>The Yazidis are a Kurdish-speaking ethno-religious group numbering approximately 700,000, primarily in Iraq's Sinjar region and Nineveh Plains, with diaspora in Germany (200,000+), Georgia, Armenia, and elsewhere. Their syncretic religion incorporates elements of ancient Iranian religions, Sufi Islam, and other traditions, centered on worship of Melek Taus (the Peacock Angel). Yazidis have faced centuries of persecution as alleged "devil worshippers"—a misrepresentation of their beliefs. The 2014 ISIS genocide killed thousands, enslaved women, and displaced the entire community, representing their 74th genocide by their count.</p>

            <h2>Melek Taus</h2>
            <p>Yazidi religion centers on Melek Taus—the Peacock Angel, God's chief angel who refused to bow to Adam and was forgiven after his tears extinguished hell's fires. Outsiders have misidentified Melek Taus as Satan, leading to "devil worshipper" accusations—a dangerous misunderstanding. Yazidis believe God created the world then delegated its management to seven angels, with Melek Taus paramount. The peacock symbolizes this angel; peacock imagery is sacred. Yazidi cosmology is complex, involving reincarnation, strict endogamy (marriage within the faith), and a caste system. Their religion is esoteric—one cannot convert to Yazidism; one must be born Yazidi.</p>

            <h2>Lalish</h2>
            <p>Lalish, in Iraqi Kurdistan's mountains, is Yazidism's holiest site—where Melek Taus first descended to earth. The temple complex features conical spires, sacred springs, and the tomb of Sheikh Adi (12th-century reformer of Yazidism). Every Yazidi should pilgrimage to Lalish at least once; the annual autumn festival draws thousands. Visitors remove shoes before entering the valley—the entire area is sacred. The Black Snake relief at the entrance must be stepped over, not on. Lalish represents Yazidi identity and survival; despite centuries of persecution, this sacred center has been maintained. It now receives increased attention after the genocide.</p>

            <h2>The 2014 Genocide</h2>
            <p>When ISIS attacked Sinjar in August 2014, they explicitly targeted Yazidis as "devil worshippers." Thousands of men were massacred; women and girls were enslaved as "sabaya" (sex slaves); children were forced into ISIS ranks. Tens of thousands fled to Mount Sinjar, besieged without food or water until Kurdish forces created an escape corridor. The UN officially recognized these acts as genocide. Approximately 400,000 Yazidis remain displaced; thousands of women remain missing. Nadia Murad, a survivor, won the Nobel Peace Prize for advocacy. The genocide threatened Yazidi existence; recovery remains uncertain.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Yazidis</h2>
            <p>Post-genocide, Yazidis face existential questions. Many refuse to return to Sinjar, traumatized and fearing future attacks; diaspora communities (especially Germany) have grown. Those remaining in Iraq navigate between Kurdish and Iraqi governance. Debates about religious reform—particularly whether children born of ISIS rape can be accepted—challenge traditional law. The community struggles with trauma, displacement, and uncertain futures. International recognition of the genocide has brought attention but limited practical support. How Yazidis rebuild community, maintain faith, and find security after their 74th genocide defines their precarious situation.</p>
