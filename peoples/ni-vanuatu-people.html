            <h2>Who Are the Ni-Vanuatu?</h2>
            <p>The Ni-Vanuatu are the indigenous Melanesian peoples of Vanuatu (formerly the New Hebrides), an archipelago of approximately 80 islands in the southwestern Pacific. Numbering about 280,000, they represent one of the world's most linguistically diverse populations—approximately 110 distinct languages are spoken, meaning Vanuatu has the highest per-capita language density on Earth. These languages belong to the Oceanic branch of Austronesian. Despite linguistic diversity, Ni-Vanuatu share cultural features including the importance of kastom (custom), ranked grade systems, and spectacular ceremonies like the Naghol land diving of Pentecost Island.</p>

            <h2>Kastom and Grade Systems</h2>
            <p>Kastom (custom/tradition) is central to Ni-Vanuatu identity, representing indigenous knowledge, practices, and values. Many islands feature elaborate grade-taking systems in which men (and sometimes women) advance through ranked grades by hosting feasts and killing pigs—tusked pigs with curved tusks being especially valuable. Each grade confers status, knowledge, and rights. These systems regulated social and political life, with high-grade men holding authority. The nakamal (meeting house) served as ceremonial and political center. Kava drinking is important—the mildly narcotic drink is consumed in evening ceremonies that facilitate social bonding and contact with ancestors. Masks, sculpture, and decorated objects accompanied rituals, though much was intentionally destroyed after use or kept secret.</p>

            <h2>Land Diving</h2>
            <p>The Naghol (land diving) of Pentecost Island is Vanuatu's most famous ritual—and the original inspiration for modern bungee jumping. Men jump from wooden towers up to 30 meters high, with only vines attached to their ankles to break their fall. The vines must be precisely measured to allow jumpers to brush the cleared ground below. Performed during the yam harvest season (April-June), Naghol ensures a good harvest and demonstrates masculine courage. The ritual has mythological origins relating to a woman who escaped her abusive husband by jumping with vines. Today, Naghol attracts tourists, creating economic opportunities and cultural preservation incentives, though concerns exist about commercialization and safety when timing is adjusted for tourist visits.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Ni-Vanuatu</h2>
            <p>Modern Vanuatu, independent since 1980 from joint British-French colonial rule (the "Condominium"), faces development challenges common to small island nations. The constitution recognizes kastom as foundation of national identity. Christianity coexists with traditional beliefs; some communities have rejected Christianity to return to kastom. Many languages face endangerment, though Bislama (an English-based creole) serves as lingua franca and national language. Climate change poses severe threats—cyclones, rising seas, and coral bleaching affect these vulnerable islands. Vanuatu consistently ranks high on "happy planet" indices despite low GDP. The nation has become vocal in international climate advocacy. Ni-Vanuatu demonstrate how diverse indigenous cultures can coexist within modern nation-states while maintaining distinctive local traditions.</p>
