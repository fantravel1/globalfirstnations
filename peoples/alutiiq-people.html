            <h2>Who Are the Alutiiq?</h2>
            <p>The Alutiiq (also Sugpiaq, meaning "real person") are an Alaska Native people inhabiting the coastal regions of southcentral Alaska, including Kodiak Island, the Alaska Peninsula, Prince William Sound, and the lower Kenai Peninsula. Numbering approximately 3,500-4,500, they speak Sugt'stun (Alutiiq), an Eskimo-Aleut language related to Yup'ik. Despite being called "Aleut" by Russian colonizers (and sometimes still confused with the Unangan/Aleut), the Alutiiq are a distinct people with their own language and culture. Their maritime adaptation produced sophisticated sea mammal hunting, kayak technology, and an elaborate material culture adapted to the North Pacific's challenging environment.</p>

            <h2>Maritime Masters</h2>
            <p>The Alutiiq developed one of the world's most sophisticated maritime cultures. Their territory—where mountains meet the sea—provided abundant marine resources: sea otters, seals, sea lions, whales, salmon, halibut, and shellfish. The qayaq (kayak) was essential technology; Alutiiq kayaks were renowned for speed and seaworthiness, allowing hunters to pursue sea mammals in the North Pacific's dangerous waters. Larger open boats (angyaq) transported families and goods. Villages situated on protected bays allowed year-round occupation. Women processed fish and sea mammal products, creating waterproof garments from intestine and feathers. This maritime adaptation sustained dense populations and complex social organization for millennia.</p>

            <h2>Russian Colonial Impact</h2>
            <p>Russian colonization from 1784 devastated Alutiiq society. The Russian-American Company exploited Alutiiq labor for the sea otter trade, forcing hunters into servitude and relocating communities. Violence, disease, and exploitation reduced the population by perhaps 80%. Many Alutiiq converted to Russian Orthodox Christianity, which remains important today. The Russian language influenced Sugt'stun, and Russian Orthodox churches dot Alutiiq villages. The 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound caused environmental and cultural damage to Alutiiq communities, contaminating subsistence resources. Despite this traumatic history, the Alutiiq maintained their identity and have achieved significant cultural recovery.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Alutiiq</h2>
            <p>Modern Alutiiq live in communities throughout their traditional territory, with significant populations in Kodiak, Cordova, and the Kenai Peninsula. Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (1971) created regional and village corporations that manage lands and economic activities. The Alutiiq Museum in Kodiak preserves and promotes cultural heritage. Language revitalization programs work to counter severe decline—perhaps 400 fluent speakers remain, mostly elderly. Traditional practices including subsistence fishing, sea mammal hunting, and basketry continue. Alutiiq artists produce work building on traditional forms. Archaeological research has revealed 7,500 years of Alutiiq occupation. The Alutiiq demonstrate how Alaska Native peoples recover from colonial devastation while maintaining connections to maritime heritage.</p>
