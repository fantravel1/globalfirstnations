            <h2>Who Are the Muckleshoot?</h2>
            <p>The Muckleshoot Indian Tribe comprises descendants of Duwamish and Puyallup peoples, with approximately 3,200 enrolled members (federally recognized). The name "Muckleshoot" derives from the Native place name for a prairie on the plateau between the White and Green rivers in Washington State. They speak Southern Lushootseed (Salish), with few remaining speakers. The Muckleshoot Reservation, established in 1857, covers approximately 5 square miles near Auburn, Washington—surrounded by the sprawling Seattle metropolitan area. Despite being one of the smallest reservations in the Northwest, the Muckleshoot have built one of the most economically successful tribal governments.</p>

            <h2>River Confluence</h2>
            <p>Traditional Muckleshoot territory centered where the White and Green rivers join to form the Duwamish River—a strategic location for salmon fishing. Both rivers supported major salmon runs; fishing villages and camps dotted their banks. The confluence was a gathering place for trade and ceremony. Mount Rainier (Tahoma) loomed over the territory, providing hunting grounds and spiritual significance. The rivers were later channeled and industrialized; the Green River became a major salmon producer through hatcheries. Despite urbanization, the Muckleshoot maintain fishing rights throughout their traditional territory, exercising treaty-guaranteed access to salmon.</p>

            <h2>Treaty and Survival</h2>
            <p>The Medicine Creek Treaty (1854) and Point Elliott Treaty (1855) established the legal framework for Muckleshoot rights. The tiny reservation—originally intended as temporary—became permanent home. Through the 20th century, the Muckleshoot fought for treaty fishing rights; the Boldt Decision (1974) affirmed their entitlement to half of harvestable fish. The tribe operates fish hatcheries and participates in co-management of Puget Sound fisheries. Unlike many tribes, the Muckleshoot never faced termination; they maintained continuous federal recognition. But land loss to non-Indian settlement, environmental degradation, and urban encroachment presented ongoing challenges.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Muckleshoot</h2>
            <p>Modern Muckleshoot have achieved remarkable economic success. The Muckleshoot Casino, one of the largest in the Northwest, generates substantial revenue. The tribe has purchased thousands of acres to expand beyond the original reservation. Tribal services include an award-winning school, health center, and housing programs. The Muckleshoot Tribal College provides higher education. Fish hatcheries produce millions of salmon annually. Despite success, challenges remain: the small reservation sits in an urban-suburban landscape of 4 million people; environmental quality continues declining. How the Muckleshoot balance economic development, environmental stewardship, and cultural preservation in the heart of metropolitan Seattle shapes this thriving tribe's future.</p>
