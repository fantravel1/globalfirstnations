            <h2>Who Are the Buryats?</h2>
            <p>The Buryats are a Mongolic people numbering approximately 500,000, primarily living around Lake Baikal in Siberia, Russia. They are the largest indigenous group in Siberia and the northernmost Buddhist population in the world. Their homeland, the Republic of Buryatia, encompasses the eastern shores of the world's oldest and deepest lake.</p>
            <p>Closely related to the Mongols of Mongolia, the Buryats developed a distinct identity under Russian rule while maintaining cultural connections across the border. Their traditional economy combined pastoral nomadism with hunting and fishing in the taiga. Today, they balance preservation of Buddhist and shamanic traditions with life in modern Russia.</p>

            <h2>Buddhism in Siberia</h2>
            <p>Tibetan Buddhism reached the Buryats in the 17th century, becoming officially recognized by the Russian Empire in 1741. The faith blended with older shamanic practices, creating a distinctive Buryat Buddhist tradition. Monasteries (datsans) became centers of learning, medicine, and art, with monks studying Tibetan language and texts.</p>
            <p>Soviet persecution devastated Buryat Buddhism—monasteries were destroyed, monks killed or imprisoned, and practice driven underground. Since 1990, revival has been dramatic. The Ivolginsky Datsan near Ulan-Ude serves as the center of Russian Buddhism, housing the preserved body of Dashi-Dorzho Itigilov, a lama who died in 1927 in meditation posture and whose body shows remarkable preservation.</p>

            <h2>Shamanic Traditions</h2>
            <p>Before and alongside Buddhism, the Buryats practiced shamanism centered on nature spirits, ancestors, and the sky god Tengri. Shamans (böö) served as healers, diviners, and intermediaries with the spirit world. Sacred sites across the landscape—mountains, springs, unusual rocks—required offerings and respect.</p>
            <p>Buryat shamanism survived Soviet persecution better than Buddhism, practiced quietly in homes and remote areas. Today, both traditions coexist, with many Buryats participating in Buddhist ceremonies while also honoring shamanic practices. The two systems have influenced each other, creating a distinctive spiritual landscape.</p>

            <h2>Lake Baikal</h2>
            <p>Lake Baikal holds profound significance for the Buryats. The world's largest freshwater lake by volume, containing 20% of Earth's surface fresh water, it is home to unique species including the nerpa (freshwater seal). Buryats call it the "Sacred Sea" and traditionally made offerings before crossing or fishing its waters.</p>
            <p>Environmental concerns have mobilized Buryat activism. Industrial pollution, proposed pipelines, and tourism development threaten the lake's unique ecosystem. Buryat organizations combine environmental advocacy with cultural preservation, arguing that protecting Baikal means protecting Buryat identity and sacred geography.</p>

            <h2>Cultural Revival</h2>
            <p>Post-Soviet Buryatia has seen cultural renaissance. The Buryat language, which had declined under Russification policies, is now taught in schools and used in media. Traditional sports—archery, horse racing, and wrestling (the "three manly games" shared with Mongols)—are celebrated at the annual Surkharban festival.</p>
            <p>Connections with Mongolia have strengthened, with cultural exchanges and recognition of shared heritage. Young Buryats increasingly embrace traditional identity while navigating modern Russian society. The tension between assimilation and preservation continues, but Buryat culture has proven resilient.</p>
