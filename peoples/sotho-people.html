            <h2>Who Are the Sotho?</h2>
            <p>The Sotho (Basotho) are a Bantu-speaking people numbering approximately 7-8 million, primarily in Lesotho (where they form nearly the entire population) and the Free State and Gauteng provinces of South Africa. They speak Sesotho (Southern Sotho), one of South Africa's official languages. The Sotho nation was forged in the 19th century by King Moshoeshoe I, who united diverse groups fleeing the difaqane wars into a new polity, using diplomacy and the defensive position of Thaba-Bosiu mountain fortress. This nation survives today as Lesotho, an independent country entirely surrounded by South Africa—a unique legacy of successful indigenous nation-building.</p>

            <h2>Moshoeshoe's Nation</h2>
            <p>The Sotho nation emerged from the chaos of the difaqane—the period of widespread warfare and migration sparked by Zulu expansion under Shaka in the 1810s-20s. Moshoeshoe I (c. 1786-1870), chief of a small clan, gathered refugees from various groups at Thaba-Bosiu, a nearly impregnable mountain fortress. Through diplomacy, strategic marriages, cattle loans (mafisa) that created client relationships, and tactical warfare, he built a significant polity. Moshoeshoe welcomed missionaries for education and diplomatic connections, playing British against Boers to preserve his territory. Though losing lowland areas to Orange Free State, he secured British protection in 1868, creating Basutoland (later Lesotho). This successful state-building, exceptional during an era of colonial expansion, is central to Sotho identity.</p>

            <h2>Culture and Tradition</h2>
            <p>Sotho culture shares features with other Southern Bantu peoples—cattle importance, ancestor veneration, patrilineal organization, initiation schools—while displaying distinctive elements. The iconic Basotho blanket, introduced by traders in the 19th century, became a powerful cultural symbol; particular patterns carry specific meanings and are worn for different occasions. The conical Basotho hat (mokorotlo) appears on Lesotho's flag. Traditional medicine (sehlare) and diviners (ngaka) remain important. Music features lesiba (a mouth bow) and distinctive vocal styles. The pitso (public assembly) allowed citizen input in governance. Initiation schools (lebollo) were central to education and social reproduction. Christianity spread widely but coexists with traditional beliefs and practices.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Sotho</h2>
            <p>Modern Sotho experience differs between Lesotho and South Africa. Lesotho, entirely dependent on South Africa economically, faces severe challenges: poverty, HIV prevalence among the world's highest, and limited economic options beyond migrant labor and textile manufacturing. Yet the nation maintains independence and distinctive identity. In South Africa, Sotho-speakers participate fully in national life; Sesotho is an official language with significant speakers. Traditional leadership continues in both countries. Migrant labor to South African mines shaped Sotho society for over a century, creating patterns of male absence and female-headed households. Climate change threatens Lesotho's water resources and agriculture. The Sotho demonstrate both successful indigenous nation-building and the ongoing challenges facing small African states.</p>
