            <h2>Who Are the Mandinka?</h2>
            <p>The Mandinka (also Mandingo, Malinke) are a Mande-speaking ethnic group of approximately 13 million people spread across West Africa—primarily Guinea, Mali, Senegal, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Ivory Coast. They are descendants and inheritors of the Mali Empire (c. 1235-1600), one of Africa's greatest pre-colonial states. The Mandinka are known for the kora (a 21-string harp-lute), their griot tradition, and their dispersal through trade networks across West Africa. The novel and TV series "Roots" brought Mandinka heritage to global attention through Kunta Kinte's story.</p>

            <h2>The Mali Empire</h2>
            <p>The Mali Empire, founded by Sundiata Keita around 1235, became one of the world's largest and wealthiest states. At its height, it stretched from the Atlantic to beyond the Niger River, controlling gold and salt trade. Mansa Musa's legendary 1324 pilgrimage to Mecca—distributing so much gold he caused inflation in Egypt—demonstrated Mali's wealth. Timbuktu became a center of Islamic scholarship. The Epic of Sundiata, performed by griots, tells the empire's founding; it remains central to Mandinka identity. Mali's legacy shapes how Mandinka see themselves—as inheritors of imperial grandeur.</p>

            <h2>The Kora</h2>
            <p>The kora is the Mandinka's distinctive instrument—a 21-string bridge-harp with a large gourd resonator, producing sounds reminiscent of both harp and flute. Kora players (jalis or griots) accompany oral histories, praise songs, and ceremonial performances. Learning kora traditionally required years of apprenticeship within griot families. Contemporary artists like Toumani Diabaté have brought kora music to international audiences, collaborating with jazz, blues, and rock musicians. The instrument represents the sophistication of West African musical traditions and has become an icon of African heritage globally.</p>

            <h2>Slavery's Impact</h2>
            <p>Mandinka were disproportionately affected by the Atlantic slave trade. Their location along trade routes and coastal access made them vulnerable; internal warfare produced captives sold to Europeans. Millions of Mandinka were enslaved; their descendants constitute significant portions of African American, Caribbean, and Brazilian populations. The story of Kunta Kinte—a Mandinka captured from Gambia in 1767—in Alex Haley's "Roots" resonated globally, sparking interest in African heritage. The Gambia's "Roots" tourism brings African Americans to trace ancestry, creating connections between diaspora and homeland.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Dispersion</h2>
            <p>Mandinka communities are dispersed across numerous West African countries, often as minorities. This dispersion resulted from Mali's expansion, trade networks, and post-empire migrations. Despite national boundaries, Mandinka maintain cross-border connections through kinship, trade, and shared culture. The Gambia is majority Mandinka (42%); elsewhere, they negotiate minority status. Common language, griot traditions, and historical memory maintain unity across political borders. The Mandinka case illustrates how African ethnic identities transcend colonial boundaries, with cultural continuity maintained despite political fragmentation.</p>
