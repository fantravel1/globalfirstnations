            <h2>Who Are the Fur?</h2>
            <p>The Fur are a Nilo-Saharan speaking people who are the largest ethnic group in Darfur, the western region of Sudan whose name means "Land of the Fur." Numbering approximately 1-2 million before the 2003 genocide, they are primarily sedentary farmers inhabiting the volcanic massif of Jebel Marra and surrounding areas. The Fur established the Sultanate of Darfur, which ruled the region for over 300 years before British conquest. Since 2003, they have been primary victims of the Darfur genocide, with hundreds of thousands killed and millions displaced in violence that continues today.</p>

            </div>

            <h2>The Sultanate of Darfur</h2>
            <p>From approximately 1650 until British conquest in 1916, the Fur ruled their own sultanate, a sophisticated Islamic state that controlled trans-Saharan trade routes, maintained a standing army, and developed administrative systems governing the diverse peoples of the region. The sultans ruled from El Fasher, administering justice, collecting taxes, and managing relations with neighboring powers including Egypt, Wadai, and the slave-trading states to the south.</p>
            <p>The Sultanate incorporated many ethnic groups under Fur dominance, including Arab nomads who would later become adversaries. This multi-ethnic polity maintained relative stability through a system that balanced the interests of settled farmers (predominantly Fur) and nomadic herders (predominantly Arab). The British destroyed this balance through colonial policies that disrupted traditional land tenure and resource-sharing arrangements, planting seeds of later conflict.</p>

            <h2>Jebel Marra: Heart of Fur Country</h2>
            <p>The Fur heartland centers on Jebel Marra, a volcanic massif rising to over 3,000 meters in western Darfur. This mountain provided water, fertile soils, and defensive positions that sustained Fur civilization for centuries. Terraced agriculture on mountain slopes, irrigated by springs and seasonal streams, produces grains, vegetables, and fruits. The cooler highland climate contrasts sharply with the surrounding semi-arid plains, creating an ecological island of productivity.</p>
            <p>Traditional Fur society organized around the mountain villages, with land held collectively by extended family groups and cultivated according to customary rules. Chiefs (shartai and dimongawi) managed village affairs, allocated land, and resolved disputes according to traditional law. This system adapted to Islam over centuries while maintaining distinctive Fur characteristics, creating a peasant society of small farmers quite different from the nomadic Arabs of the surrounding plains.</p>

            <h2>The Darfur Genocide</h2>
            <p>Beginning in 2003, the Sudanese government responded to rebel movements in Darfur by unleashing Arab militias (Janjaweed) against the civilian population. The Fur, as the largest non-Arab group and associated with the rebellion, were specifically targeted. Villages were burned, wells poisoned, crops destroyed, women raped, and men killed. The International Criminal Court indicted Sudan's president for genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.</p>
            <p>The genocide killed an estimated 300,000-400,000 people and displaced over 2.5 million, creating massive refugee camps in Darfur and neighboring Chad. Fur villages were systematically destroyed and often occupied by Arab settlers, implementing a policy of ethnic cleansing. Despite international attention and peacekeeping efforts, violence continued for years, with periodic escalations. The 2019 fall of the al-Bashir government brought hope, but instability in Sudan has prevented resolution.</p>

            <h2>Culture Under Siege</h2>
            <p>Fur culture centers on agriculture, community solidarity, and Islamic faith. Traditional music features distinctive drums and stringed instruments accompanying songs for work, weddings, and celebrations. Crafts include leatherwork, basketry, and pottery. Oral traditions preserve history, genealogy, and cultural values. Marriage customs, initiation rites, and burial practices blend Islamic requirements with older Fur traditions.</p>
            <p>Displacement has scattered this culture. Refugee camps provide physical survival but little opportunity for traditional life. Farmers cannot farm; communities are fragmented; young people grow up without connection to ancestral lands. In diaspora (small communities exist in Egypt, Libya, and Western countries), maintaining Fur identity requires conscious effort. Yet in the camps and abroad, the Fur preserve their language, tell their stories, and dream of return to Jebel Marra.</p>

            <h2>Seeking Justice and Return</h2>
            <p>The Fur demand justice for genocide and the right to return to their lands. Darfuri civil society organizations document atrocities, advocate internationally, and work toward accountability. The International Criminal Court warrants for Sudanese leaders represent partial victories, though the suspects remain at large. Peace processes have produced agreements that largely fail to address land occupation and returns, leaving fundamental issues unresolved.</p>
            <p>The future remains uncertain. Sudan's political instability following al-Bashir's fall has brought new violence and delayed progress toward justice. Climate change intensifies competition for land and water that underlies the conflict. Yet the Fur endure—in camps, in remaining villages, in diaspora—preserving identity and insisting that "Darfur" truly belongs to the Fur and their neighbors who have lived there for centuries.</p>
