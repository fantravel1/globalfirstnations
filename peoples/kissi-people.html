            <h2>Who Are the Kissi?</h2>
            <p>The Kissi (Gizi, Kisi) are an ethnic group inhabiting the tripoint region where Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia meet, numbering approximately 600,000-800,000 across all three countries. They speak Kissi, an Atlantic language of the Niger-Congo family. The Kissi occupy the forested highlands of the region, practicing rice farming as their primary agricultural activity. They are particularly known for the mysterious stone figures (pomtan or nomoli) found throughout their territory, which they interpret as images of ancestors. The Kissi were historically caught between larger powers—Mandinka empires, colonial forces, and post-colonial states—yet maintained distinct cultural identity.</p>

            <h2>The Pomtan Stone Figures</h2>
            <p>Throughout Kissi territory, farmers unearth distinctive stone figures known as pomtan (or nomoli in Mende areas). These soapstone carvings, often depicting human figures with large heads, date from roughly 1000-1600 CE—long predating the Kissi arrival in the region. The Kissi did not carve these figures but discovered them in fields and interpret them as representations of ancestors. The pomtan are believed to protect crops, ensure fertility, and provide spiritual guidance. Farmers who find them often install them in rice fields as guardians. These mysterious sculptures have attracted scholarly attention, with their true origins remaining debated. They represent one of Africa's archaeological puzzles.</p>

            <h2>Traditional Economy</h2>
            <p>Kissi economy traditionally centered on rice cultivation in upland forest environments. Wet rice paddies and swidden (slash-and-burn) cultivation produced the staple crop. The Kissi also manufactured and traded "Kissi pennies"—twisted iron rods that served as currency across the region from medieval times until the colonial period. These iron currencies facilitated long-distance trade and bore spiritual significance. Blacksmithing thus held high status. Palm products, kola nuts, and forest goods supplemented agricultural production. The modern economy incorporates coffee and cocoa cultivation for export, along with diamond mining in Sierra Leone and Liberia portions of Kissi territory.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Kissi</h2>
            <p>Modern Kissi are divided among three nations, with borders cutting across traditional territories. Guinea's Kissi population is largest, followed by Sierra Leone and Liberia. The civil wars in Sierra Leone (1991-2002) and Liberia (1989-2003) devastated Kissi areas in those countries, with many refugees fleeing to Guinea. Cross-border family ties remain strong despite national boundaries. Post-war reconstruction has proceeded unevenly. Agricultural development, education expansion, and infrastructure improvement remain priorities. The Kissi navigate multiple national identities while maintaining ethnic connections across borders. How they preserve cultural heritage—including the pomtan tradition—while developing economically defines their transnational community's future.</p>
