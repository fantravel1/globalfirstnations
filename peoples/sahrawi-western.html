            <h2>Who Are the Sahrawi?</h2>
            <p>The Sahrawi are the indigenous Hassaniya Arabic-speaking people of Western Sahara, a disputed territory on Africa's northwest coast. Numbering approximately 500,000, they are divided between Moroccan-controlled Western Sahara, refugee camps in Algeria, and diaspora communities. Their homeland remains the world's largest non-self-governing territory, often called "Africa's last colony."</p>
            <p>Historically nomadic pastoralists and traders traversing the vast Saharan desert, the Sahrawi developed a distinctive culture blending Arab, Berber, and sub-Saharan African elements. Their society centered on the tribe and extended family, with oral poetry, music, and elaborate hospitality traditions marking their identity.</p>

            </div>

            <h2>Desert Nomadic Life</h2>
            <p>Traditional Sahrawi life revolved around camel and goat herding across the harsh Saharan landscape. Families lived in khayma (tents) woven from goat and camel hair, moving seasonally to follow pasture and water. The camel was central to survival—providing milk, meat, transport, and materials for trade.</p>
            <p>Society organized into tribes (qabila) and extended family units, with complex systems of kinship, alliance, and responsibility. Poetry and music were highly valued arts; poets held honored positions, and their verses preserved history, celebrated heroes, and commented on society. The ritual of Sahrawi tea—three glasses served with elaborate ceremony—symbolized hospitality.</p>

            <h2>The Conflict</h2>
            <p>When Spain withdrew from its colony in 1975, Morocco and Mauritania invaded, prompting the Polisario Front to declare the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) and launch guerrilla war. Mauritania withdrew in 1979, but Morocco built a 2,700-kilometer sand wall (berm) dividing the territory and continued to claim sovereignty.</p>
            <p>Approximately 173,000 Sahrawi have lived in refugee camps near Tindouf, Algeria since 1975—among the world's longest-standing refugee situations. A 1991 ceasefire promised a referendum on independence, but disputes over voter eligibility have prevented the vote from occurring. The UN maintains a peacekeeping mission (MINURSO) that monitors the ceasefire.</p>

            <h2>Life in the Camps</h2>
            <p>The Tindouf refugee camps have become semi-permanent settlements governed by the SADR. Despite harsh desert conditions and dependence on international aid, the camps developed schools, hospitals, and administrative structures. Literacy rates, especially among women, exceed those of many neighboring countries.</p>
            <p>Women play unusually prominent roles in Sahrawi refugee society, managing camp administration while men historically focused on military struggle. This gender dynamic, combined with education emphasis, has created a distinctive social structure. The camps maintain cultural traditions including poetry festivals, traditional crafts, and the Sahrawi tea ceremony.</p>

            <h2>Cultural Preservation</h2>
            <p>Despite displacement, Sahrawi actively preserve their cultural heritage. The Tifariti cultural festival celebrates poetry, music, and traditional arts. Sahrawi film and literature have gained international attention, documenting both traditional life and the struggle for self-determination. Musicians blend traditional styles with modern influences.</p>
            <p>The melhfa, a colorful wrapped garment worn by women, remains a powerful symbol of Sahrawi identity. Traditional jewelry, leatherwork, and tent-weaving skills are transmitted to younger generations even in the camps. Oral poetry continues as a living art form, now addressing contemporary themes of exile and resistance alongside traditional subjects.</p>
