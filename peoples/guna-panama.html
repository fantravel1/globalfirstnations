            <h2>Who Are the Guna?</h2>
            <p>The Guna (formerly spelled Kuna) are an indigenous people of approximately 80,000, inhabiting the San Blas Archipelago (Guna Yala—365 islands off Panama's Caribbean coast) and two mainland comarcas. They speak Guna, a Chibchan language. The Guna are exceptional among indigenous peoples for achieving substantial political autonomy—Guna Yala is a self-governing comarca (indigenous territory) where Guna control tourism, immigration, and internal affairs. Their 1925 revolution against Panamanian assimilation policies succeeded in establishing this autonomy. Famous for mola textile art, the Guna demonstrate how indigenous peoples can maintain sovereignty within modern nation-states.</p>

            <h2>The 1925 Revolution</h2>
            <p>In 1925, the Guna revolted against Panamanian police who were suppressing their culture—banning traditional dress, ceremonies, and practices in forced assimilation campaigns. The Guna Revolution, supported briefly by the US (which had interests in the Canal Zone), resulted in Panamanian recognition of Guna autonomy. The 1938 Law 16 formally established the Comarca de San Blas (now Guna Yala), granting self-governance. This successful indigenous resistance—achieving legally recognized autonomy through armed uprising—is exceptional in the Americas. The revolution remains central to Guna identity and demonstrates possibilities for indigenous political mobilization.</p>

            <h2>Mola Art</h2>
            <p>Mola are intricate textile panels created by Guna women using reverse appliqué—layers of cloth cut and sewn to reveal colors beneath, creating complex geometric and figurative designs. Originally worn as front and back panels of traditional blouses, molas have become internationally collected art. Designs range from abstract patterns to depictions of animals, plants, and contemporary imagery (even politics and pop culture). Mola quality indicates a woman's skill and status. The art form, developed relatively recently (19th century), demonstrates Guna cultural creativity and adaptability. Mola sales provide significant income while maintaining traditional practice.</p>

            <h2>Governance and Tourism</h2>
            <p>Guna Yala's governance combines traditional structures (the General Congress of Guna Yala, village councils) with formal Panamanian recognition. The Guna control who enters their territory—all visitors need permits; foreign ownership is prohibited; tourism is community-controlled. Hotels are Guna-owned or pay fees to communities. This model protects against the exploitative tourism common elsewhere while generating income. Guna representatives negotiate directly with Panama on matters affecting their territory. While challenges exist (poverty, limited healthcare, migration to Panama City), Guna governance demonstrates indigenous alternatives to assimilation or marginalization.</p>

            <h2>Climate Change Threat</h2>
            <p>Guna Yala faces existential climate threat—many islands are barely above sea level, increasingly flooded by rising seas and storm surges. Some communities have already begun relocating to mainland areas. This climate displacement threatens not just homes but the island-based culture developed over centuries. The Guna have been vocal in international climate forums, highlighting their situation as early climate refugees despite minimal contribution to emissions. How the Guna adapt—whether mainland relocation preserves community and culture, or whether island loss means cultural transformation—presents one of climate change's most immediate indigenous impacts.</p>
