            <h2>Who Are the Siwi?</h2>
            <p>The Siwi are a Berber people inhabiting Siwa Oasis, an isolated depression in Egypt's Western Desert near the Libyan border, approximately 50 kilometers from the sand seas that once made it nearly inaccessible. Numbering approximately 25,000-30,000, they are Egypt's only indigenous Berber-speaking population. They speak Siwi, an Eastern Berber language with unique features resulting from centuries of isolation. Siwa was famous in antiquity as the site of the Oracle of Amun, consulted by Alexander the Great. Today, the oasis is known for dates, olives, distinctive mud-brick architecture, and a culture markedly different from mainstream Egypt.</p>

            <h2>Ancient Oracle</h2>
            <p>Siwa's greatest historical fame derives from the Temple of the Oracle of Amun, one of the ancient world's most revered oracular sites. The temple (now ruins called the Temple of Amun at Aghurmi) attracted pilgrims and rulers seeking divine guidance. In 331 BCE, Alexander the Great made the dangerous journey to consult the oracle, where (according to tradition) he was declared son of Zeus-Amun, legitimizing his divine-king status. The oracle's importance faded with Christianity and Islam, but the pilgrimage route that brought visitors also brought ideas, goods, and the population that made Siwa a distinctive cultural enclave. The oracle's ruins remain Siwa's primary archaeological attraction.</p>

            <h2>Distinctive Culture</h2>
            <p>Siwi culture developed distinctively due to extreme isolation. Until the 20th century, the oasis was accessible only by camel caravan across dangerous desert. This isolation preserved Berber language and customs when neighboring areas Arabized. Traditional Siwa featured unique architecture—houses built from karsheef (salt-mud bricks), with distinctive fortified old towns (Shali being the most famous). Social organization was highly conservative; women's seclusion was strict; gender segregation intense. Same-sex relationships among men were historically institutionalized in forms unusual elsewhere in the Islamic world. Agriculture centered on dates and olives, watered by springs creating the oasis. Many traditions have eroded with roads, tourism, and Egyptian state integration.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Siwi</h2>
            <p>Modern Siwa has been transformed by connection to Egypt. Roads (since 1984) ended isolation; tourism has grown; Egyptian settlement has increased. The Siwi language faces pressure from Arabic, the dominant national language and medium of education. Young people increasingly speak Arabic; Siwi may not survive another generation without intervention. Traditional architecture deteriorated as concrete replaced karsheef. Tourism brings income but also cultural commodification and sometimes exploitation. The Egyptian government has occasionally promoted Siwa's "exoticism" while doing little to support Berber language rights (Egypt does not recognize Berber as a minority language). The Siwi navigate being Egypt's only Berber enclave—culturally precious but politically invisible, their distinctiveness simultaneously valued for tourism and neglected in policy.</p>
