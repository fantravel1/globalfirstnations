            <h2>Who Are the Kanak?</h2>
            <p>The Kanak are the indigenous Melanesian people of New Caledonia (Kanaky), a French special collectivity in the southwestern Pacific. Numbering approximately 100,000-110,000 (about 40% of New Caledonia's population), they speak about 28 distinct languages from the Oceanic branch of Austronesian. The Kanak have long struggled for recognition, land rights, and independence from France, with their political movement becoming one of the Pacific's most significant decolonization efforts. The word "Kanak" (originally a derogatory term derived from "kanaka," Hawaiian for "person") was reclaimed as a term of pride and political identity during the independence struggle.</p>

            <h2>Traditional Culture</h2>
            <p>Traditional Kanak society was organized around clans with strong connections to specific lands and totemic ancestors. The Grande Case (big house) served as ceremonial and political center. Chiefs held hereditary positions, though their authority was balanced by clan councils. The custom (la coutume) governed social relations, including elaborate exchange ceremonies involving yams, taro, and valued objects. The flèche faîtière (roof spear) adorning house peaks and carved wooden figures represented ancestors and clan identity. Yam cultivation held ritual importance beyond nutrition. These traditions, suppressed during colonization, experienced revival as central to Kanak identity during the independence movement. The Tjibaou Cultural Centre in Nouméa, designed by Renzo Piano, celebrates Kanak culture in modern architectural form.</p>

            <h2>Colonization and Resistance</h2>
            <p>French colonization from 1853 devastated Kanak society. Used as a penal colony (New Caledonia received French convicts until 1897), the territory saw massive land alienation. Kanak were confined to reserves, subjected to the Code de l'Indigénat restricting their movements and rights. Rebellions were crushed. By the 1970s-80s, a strong independence movement emerged—the FLNKS (Front de Libération Nationale Kanak et Socialiste) led by Jean-Marie Tjibaou. Violent conflict in the 1980s (les événements) brought New Caledonia to crisis, culminating in the 1988 Ouvéa cave massacre. The Matignon-Nouméa Accords (1988, 1998) established a path toward self-determination through referendums. Tjibaou's assassination in 1989 removed the movement's most prominent leader.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Kanak</h2>
            <p>Modern Kanak navigate between traditional identity and French citizenship. Three independence referendums (2018, 2020, 2021) failed to achieve independence, though support was significant (especially in 2020, at 46.7%). The political situation remains contested. Kanak languages, though none majority-spoken, receive official recognition and educational support. Traditional customs remain important, including exchange ceremonies and clan structures. The nickel industry (New Caledonia has significant deposits) provides economic opportunities but raises environmental and ownership questions. Health, education, and economic disparities between Kanak and settler populations persist. The Kanak demonstrate the complexities of indigenous politics in settler colonial contexts—maintaining cultural identity while engaging in political struggles over sovereignty, within frameworks imposed by colonial powers.</p>
