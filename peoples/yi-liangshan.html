            <h2>Who Are the Yi?</h2>
            <p>The Yi (historically called Lolo by outsiders) are one of China's largest ethnic minorities, numbering approximately 9 million people across Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi provinces. The Liangshan Yi of the Daliang Mountains in Sichuan represent the most culturally distinct group, having maintained unusual independence from Chinese state authority until 1956, preserving a unique caste system and social structure unlike any other in East Asia.</p>
            <p>The Yi have their own ancient script, one of the few indigenous writing systems in China, and a rich tradition of oral poetry, religious texts, and historical chronicles. Their culture reflects millennia of mountain isolation, featuring distinctive costume, architecture, and religious practices centered on bimo priests.</p>

            <h2>The Caste System</h2>
            <p>Traditional Liangshan society was organized into rigid castes that determined every aspect of life. The nuoho ("Black Yi") formed the aristocratic ruling class, comprising perhaps 7% of the population. Below them were the quho ("White Yi"), a stratum of commoners. The lowest castes—gaxi and ajia—were slaves who could be bought, sold, and passed down as property.</p>
            <p>This system persisted until the Communist revolution. In 1956, the government implemented "Democratic Reform," abolishing slavery and redistributing land. The transformation was dramatic—Liangshan was described as skipping directly from slave society to socialism. However, social memory of caste distinctions persists, affecting marriage patterns and social relations even today.</p>

            <h2>Bimo Religion</h2>
            <p>Traditional Yi religion centers on the bimo, hereditary priest-shamans who memorize vast corpora of ritual texts, perform ceremonies, and mediate between humans and spirits. The bimo read and write the Yi script, preserving religious knowledge in manuscripts passed through lineages. Their ceremonies address illness, death, agriculture, and warfare.</p>
            <p>The Yi cosmos includes numerous spirits dwelling in natural features, ancestors requiring propitiation, and ghosts causing misfortune. Major festivals include the Torch Festival in summer, when families light torches to drive away pests and evil spirits, and ceremonies marking agricultural cycles and life transitions. These practices continue despite decades of government discouragement.</p>

            <h2>The Yi Script</h2>
            <p>The classical Yi script (nuosu bburma) is a syllabary with thousands of characters representing syllables of the Yi language. Different regional traditions developed distinct character sets. The script recorded religious texts, genealogies, medical knowledge, and historical chronicles, though literacy was traditionally restricted to the bimo class.</p>
            <p>In 1975, the Chinese government standardized a simplified Yi script with 819 characters for use in education and publishing. Traditional manuscripts remain treasured cultural artifacts, with efforts underway to preserve and digitize ancient texts before they are lost.</p>

            <h2>Modern Challenges</h2>
            <p>Liangshan today faces significant challenges. The region remains among China's poorest, with development efforts often creating tension with traditional ways of life. Drug addiction and HIV/AIDS epidemics have devastated some communities. Education policies promoting Mandarin Chinese threaten Yi language transmission.</p>
            <p>Yet Yi identity remains strong. The Torch Festival draws tourists while maintaining cultural significance. Young Yi artists and musicians blend traditional elements with contemporary forms. Scholars document fading traditions before elder knowledge-keepers pass away. The Yi represent a remarkable example of cultural persistence in the face of dramatic political and economic transformation.</p>
