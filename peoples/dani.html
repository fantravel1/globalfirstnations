            <h2>Who Are the Dani?</h2>
            <p>The **Dani** are a Papuan people inhabiting the **Baliem Valley** in the central highlands of Papua (formerly Irian Jaya), Indonesia—one of the last major populations "discovered" by the outside world when American explorer Richard Archbold's expedition flew over the valley in 1938. Numbering approximately **300,000 people** today, the Dani developed a sophisticated agricultural civilization at 1,600 meters elevation, cultivating sweet potatoes in elaborate drainage systems while raising pigs as wealth and ceremonial offerings. They are famous for ritualized warfare, distinctive body decoration including penis gourds (**koteka**), and the practice of women amputating finger joints as mourning for deceased relatives. Though now largely Christian and integrated into Indonesian society, the Dani maintain distinctive cultural practices.</p>

            <h2>The Baliem Valley Civilization</h2>
            <p>When Archbold flew over the Baliem Valley in 1938, he discovered a densely populated agricultural landscape previously unknown to the outside world—extensive gardens, villages, and a population of perhaps 50,000. The Dani had developed this highland civilization over thousands of years, transforming the valley floor through elaborate **drainage and irrigation systems** that enabled intensive sweet potato cultivation. Sweet potatoes (introduced from the Americas via Portuguese traders, perhaps 300-400 years ago) became the staple; before that, taro was likely primary. **Pigs** were—and remain—central to Dani economy and ceremony: pig feasts mark alliances, marriages, and warfare truces; pig wealth determines status. The valley's isolation, surrounded by nearly impassable mountains, allowed this complex society to develop largely independently until mid-20th century contact.</p>

            <h2>Ritual Warfare</h2>
            <p>The Dani practiced elaborate **ritual warfare** between confederations of villages, documented extensively by anthropologist Karl Heider and filmmakers in the 1960s. Battles were formalized events: warriors from opposing groups would meet at designated battlegrounds, exchanging arrows, spears, and taunts. Deaths occurred—perhaps 5% of male deaths resulted from warfare—but battles were often broken off after first blood. Warfare served social functions beyond territory: it maintained group cohesion, provided masculine prestige, and was integrated with spiritual beliefs about ghosts who required vengeance. Women and children were rarely targeted. Indonesian authorities suppressed warfare after 1962 annexation; today, ceremonial "mock battles" sometimes occur for tourists and festivals, maintaining forms while removing lethal content.</p>

            <h2>Body Decoration and Mourning</h2>
            <p>Dani body decoration is striking. Men traditionally wear the **koteka** (penis gourd)—dried gourds that cover and point upward, varying by region and social status. Body decoration includes pig grease mixed with soot, boar tusks through nasal septums, and elaborate feather headdresses for ceremonies. Most controversial to outside observers is the traditional practice of **finger amputation** (ikipalin): when a close relative died, women and girls would have finger joints cut off as mourning. The practice expressed grief through permanent bodily change. Indonesian government banned finger amputation decades ago; it has largely ceased, though many older women bear the marks. These practices challenge outside observers' assumptions about bodily integrity while representing meaningful cultural expressions of grief, status, and identity.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Dani</h2>
            <p>Today's Dani navigate between tradition and modernity within the contested political context of Papua. Christianity (primarily Protestant) is now dominant; traditional religion has largely receded. Education in Indonesian creates generational language shift, though Dani languages remain widely spoken. Subsistence agriculture continues alongside cash economy participation. The annual **Baliem Valley Festival** showcases traditional culture for tourists—mock battles, pig feasts, traditional dress—providing income while raising questions about cultural performance versus practice. Papua's political situation is fraught: Papuan independence movements resist Indonesian control; security forces have committed human rights abuses; and resource extraction threatens indigenous lands. The Dani, like other Papuan peoples, face questions of cultural survival within this difficult political context.</p>
