            <h2>Who Are the Mohave?</h2>
            <p>The Mohave (also Mojave, Aha Macav meaning "people who live along the water") are a Yuman-speaking indigenous people of the lower Colorado River, traditionally inhabiting the Mohave Valley where the river forms the present-day Arizona-Nevada-California border. They speak Mohave, a River Yuman language related to Quechan and Maricopa. The Mohave were the most numerous and powerful of the river peoples, with pre-contact populations estimated at 3,000-4,000. They were famous as warriors, dreamers, and runners who traveled vast distances across the desert. Today, the Fort Mojave Indian Tribe and Colorado River Indian Tribes together have approximately 3,500 enrolled Mohave members.</p>

            <h2>River Farmers</h2>
            <p>Unlike most Yuman peoples, the Mohave were agriculturalists, exploiting the Colorado River's annual flooding to grow corn, beans, squash, and melons in the rich bottomlands. The river's spring floods deposited silt that enabled farming without irrigation—crops were planted as floodwaters receded. This river-based agriculture supported larger, more settled populations than possible for neighboring desert peoples. Fish, particularly the Colorado squawfish (now endangered), supplemented crops; wild plants including mesquite beans were gathered. The Mohave developed close connections with the river; their homeland was the fertile valley floor, while surrounding desert was traveled but not permanently occupied.</p>

            <h2>Dreamers and Warriors</h2>
            <p>Mohave spiritual life centered on dreaming. Dreams received before birth were believed to confer power and knowledge; shamans, warriors, and singers all drew authority from dreams. Dream songs—elaborate oral compositions received in visions—could be sung for hours and transmitted esoteric knowledge. The Mohave were renowned as warriors, fighting extensively with the Maricopa and occasionally with other peoples. War parties traveled vast distances; the Mohave were accomplished runners who could cover 100 miles in a day. Tattoos, body paint, and warfare were central to male identity. This warrior culture brought the Mohave into conflict with Spanish, Mexican, and American intruders; they resisted colonization longer than many southwestern peoples.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Mohave</h2>
            <p>Modern Mohave live primarily on the Fort Mojave Reservation (spanning Arizona, California, and Nevada) and the Colorado River Indian Reservation (shared with Chemehuevi, Hopi, and Navajo). Both tribes have developed agricultural enterprises exploiting Colorado River water rights, growing cotton, alfalfa, and other crops. The Fort Mojave Tribe operates a casino and resort; both tribes have diversified economies. The Mohave language is endangered but actively taught in tribal education programs. Cultural revitalization includes documentation of dream songs (though some sacred knowledge is not shared outside the tribe), traditional plant knowledge, and beadwork traditions. The Mohave maintain connection to the river that defines their identity, even as dams and diversions have transformed its natural flow.</p>
