            <h2>Who Are the Yapese?</h2>
            <p>The Yapese are the indigenous Micronesian people of Yap State in the Federated States of Micronesia, numbering approximately 11,000-12,000. They speak Yapese, an Austronesian language with a highly complex system of honorific registers that encode social relationships. Yap is famous worldwide for its unique stone money (rai)—large circular disks quarried from Palau and transported by canoe, some weighing several tons. Beyond this dramatic feature, Yapese culture is notable for its elaborate caste system, complex land tenure, and navigational traditions. Yap proper (the main islands) historically dominated a maritime empire extending across the outer islands.</p>

            <h2>Stone Money and Exchange</h2>
            <p>Yapese stone money (rai) represents one of the world's most distinctive currency systems. These large stone disks, ranging from inches to 12 feet in diameter, were quarried in Palau, 250 miles away, and transported by outrigger canoe—a dangerous voyage that gave the stones value. Larger stones could not be moved and remained in place; ownership transferred through oral agreement witnessed by the community. The money served for major transactions—land transfers, political alliances, marriage arrangements, and compensation—while shell money and turmeric served smaller exchanges. Stone money continues to function today alongside modern currency, demonstrating how traditional value systems can persist. Yapese culture developed multiple exchange media for different social purposes.</p>

            <h2>Caste System and Empire</h2>
            <p>Traditional Yapese society was organized into a complex caste system with ranked villages and hereditary social positions. High-caste villages controlled land and political authority; low-caste villages had specific service obligations. Movement between castes was largely impossible. This hierarchical system extended to Yap's outer islands—coral atolls stretching hundreds of miles east—which paid tribute to Yap in a relationship called sawei. Outer islanders brought woven textiles, rope, and other products; Yap provided ritual protection and permission to access land. The master navigators of the outer islands maintained traditional non-instrument navigation. This "Yapese Empire" represented one of Micronesia's most complex political systems.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Yapese</h2>
            <p>Modern Yap maintains strong cultural identity within the Federated States of Micronesia. Traditional practices including the caste system (though modified), land tenure, stone money, and outer island relationships continue. The Yapese language remains vital, with elaborate honorific registers still used to encode social relationships. Traditional dress (men's thu and women's grass skirts) is still worn for cultural events and by some daily. Village councils and traditional chiefs retain significant authority alongside constitutional government. Tourism provides economic opportunities, though Yap has developed more slowly than other Micronesian states. Climate change threatens outer island communities. Yap demonstrates how elaborate traditional social systems can persist into modernity while adapting to changed circumstances.</p>
