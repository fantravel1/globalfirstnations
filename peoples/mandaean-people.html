            <h2>Who Are the Mandaeans?</h2>
            <p>The Mandaeans (Sabian Mandaeans) are an ethnoreligious group practicing Mandaeism, an ancient Gnostic religion. Historically centered in southern Iraq and southwestern Iran along the rivers Tigris, Euphrates, and Karun, they numbered approximately 60,000-70,000 before 2003; now perhaps 5,000-10,000 remain in Iraq, with most having fled as refugees to Iran, Jordan, Syria, Australia, Sweden, and elsewhere. They speak Mandaic, a dialect of Aramaic, for religious purposes, and Arabic vernacularly. Mandaeans are often called "Sabians" in Islamic texts, granting them protected (dhimmi) status. They venerate John the Baptist and practice frequent ritual immersion in flowing water (masbuta), which is central to their religion. Mandaeans may be the last surviving Gnostic community from late antiquity.</p>

            <h2>Mandaean Religion</h2>
            <p>Mandaeism is a Gnostic religion emphasizing knowledge (manda) of the divine realm and the soul's journey to the World of Light. The supreme being, Hayyi Rabbi ("Great Life"), emanates lesser divine beings. The material world, including the body, is created by a demiurge and entraps the soul. Salvation comes through gnosis and ritual, particularly masbuta—immersion in flowing water (symbolizing "living water" from the World of Light). Unlike Christian baptism, masbuta is performed repeatedly throughout life, ideally every Sunday. White robes worn during rituals symbolize purity. John the Baptist is revered as a prophet; Jesus is viewed ambivalently. Mandaean priests (tarmida) undergo lengthy training and perform complex rituals. Scripture includes the Ginza Rabba ("Great Treasure") and other texts in Mandaic. The religion is non-proselytizing—one must be born Mandaean.</p>

            <h2>Silversmiths of the Rivers</h2>
            <p>Mandaeans traditionally worked as silversmiths and goldsmiths, a trade passed through families. They crafted jewelry, decorative items, and religious objects, gaining reputations as skilled artisans. Other Mandaeans were boat builders (mashhufa) along the rivers. Both professions reflected their riverine adaptation—living along watercourses essential for masbuta while avoiding agriculture and animal husbandry (considered impure). The silversmith tradition provided economic niche and community identity. Modern Mandaeans have diversified into professional occupations, particularly in diaspora, though some maintain metalworking. The connection to rivers remains central—Mandaean communities settle near rivers or lakes where masbuta can be performed, though pollution and diaspora conditions sometimes require adaptation.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Mandaeans</h2>
            <p>The 2003 Iraq War devastated the Mandaean community. Targeted by sectarian violence—as neither Muslim, Christian, nor protected by tribal structures—Mandaeans faced kidnapping, murder, and forced conversion. Most fled, scattering to distant diaspora communities. Australia hosts the largest Mandaean population outside the Middle East (approximately 10,000), with communities in Sydney and Melbourne maintaining temples and priests. Sweden, Germany, and other countries also host refugees. Performing masbuta requires adaptation in diaspora—some communities use swimming pools, lakes, or even baptismal fonts. Traditional religious knowledge, concentrated among aging priests, faces transmission challenges. Young Mandaeans in the West often assimilate or become secular. The question of whether Mandaeism can survive dispersal haunts the community. Marriage outside the faith was traditionally forbidden; some communities now accept converts. The Mandaeans represent both the richness of Mesopotamian religious diversity and its fragility under modern pressures.</p>
