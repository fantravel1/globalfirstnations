            <h2>Who Are the Evenki?</h2>
            <p>The Evenki, formerly known as the Tungus, are a Tungusic-speaking indigenous people inhabiting vast territories across Siberia, from the Yenisei River to the Pacific Ocean, and from the Arctic tundra to the Amur River. Their traditional territory spans approximately 2.5 million square kilometers—larger than Western Europe—making them the indigenous people with the largest territorial range on Earth. Their culture centers on reindeer herding, hunting, and a profound spiritual connection to the taiga forest.</p>

            <h2>The Reindeer People</h2>
            <p>The Evenki relationship with reindeer defines their culture. Unlike the large-herd pastoralism of the Nenets to their west, Evenki traditionally kept smaller herds of reindeer primarily as pack and riding animals rather than for meat. This allowed them to pursue a semi-nomadic hunting lifestyle, using reindeer to transport camps and equipment through the trackless taiga while hunting wild game for subsistence.</p>
            <p>Evenki reindeer are specially trained for riding and packing, with different animals specialized for different tasks. A skilled Evenki can read reindeer behavior to find water, sense danger, or navigate in blizzards. The bond between herder and animal is intimate—reindeer are given names, mourned at death, and treated as partners rather than property.</p>

            <h2>The Chum and Nomadic Life</h2>
            <p>Traditional Evenki housing centered on the chum, a conical tent covered with reindeer hides in winter and birch bark in summer. The chum could be erected in under an hour and transported by reindeer, enabling the frequent moves required by their hunting-herding economy. Inside, a central fire provided warmth and cooking, with sleeping areas arranged around the periphery according to family relationships and gender.</p>
            <p>Seasonal movements followed game migrations and reindeer pasture requirements. Spring brought moves to calving grounds, summer to highland pastures free of insects, autumn to rutting areas, and winter to sheltered valleys. This annual cycle required intimate knowledge of thousands of square kilometers of territory, passed down through generations.</p>

            <h2>Shamanism and Spirituality</h2>
            <p>Evenki shamanism profoundly influenced global understanding of the practice—the very word "shaman" derives from the Evenki "šamán." Evenki shamans served as healers, diviners, and intermediaries between human and spirit worlds. Wearing elaborate costumes adorned with metal ornaments representing spirit helpers, shamans entered trance states through drumming and chanting, journeying to upper and lower worlds to retrieve lost souls or negotiate with spirits.</p>
            <p>The Evenki cosmos was animated by spirits inhabiting every aspect of nature. Rivers, mountains, animals, and trees all possessed spiritual essences requiring respect and propitiation. Hunters conducted elaborate rituals before and after kills, ensuring the animal's spirit would be reborn and future hunting success guaranteed. This spiritual ecology enforced sustainable resource use through sacred obligation.</p>

            <h2>Soviet Transformation</h2>
            <p>The Soviet period brought traumatic changes to Evenki life. Collectivization forced nomads into permanent settlements, separated families from their reindeer, and suppressed shamanic practice. Children were sent to boarding schools where speaking Evenki was punished. Traditional territories were carved up for industrial development, including some of the world's largest diamond and gold mines.</p>
            <p>Yet Evenki culture proved resilient. Many families maintained reindeer herding within collective farms, passing knowledge to new generations despite official discouragement. Shamanic practices continued underground, emerging after the Soviet collapse. Today, approximately 20,000 Evenki still practice reindeer herding, and language revitalization programs work to preserve their Tungusic tongue.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Challenges</h2>
            <p>Modern Evenki face pressures from resource extraction, climate change, and demographic decline. Mining, oil drilling, and logging fragment reindeer pastures and pollute waters. Warming temperatures alter migration patterns of prey animals and reindeer alike. Many young Evenki leave for cities, and the language is classified as endangered despite revitalization efforts.</p>
            <p>Indigenous rights activism has grown, with Evenki organizations advocating for land rights, environmental protection, and cultural preservation. Some communities have successfully blocked mining projects; others have negotiated benefit-sharing agreements. The challenge remains balancing economic development with preservation of a way of life that has sustained people in the taiga for millennia.</p>
