            <h2>Who Are the Temiar?</h2>
            <p>The Temiar are a Senoi Orang Asli group of Peninsular Malaysia, numbering approximately 30,000-35,000 people. They speak Temiar, an Aslian language of the Austroasiatic family closely related to Semai. The Temiar inhabit the mountainous rainforest interior of Perak and Kelantan states. They are particularly known for their elaborate musical and ceremonial traditions, especially the trance-dancing ceremonies featuring songs received in dreams. Anthropologist Marina Roseman's detailed ethnomusicological work has documented Temiar "singing, remembering, and healing" practices as a sophisticated system of cultural and spiritual expression.</p>

            <h2>Dream Songs</h2>
            <p>Temiar ceremonial life centers on songs received in dreams from spirit-guides (gunig). Individuals encounter spirits of mountains, rivers, flowers, or deceased relatives in dreams, who teach them unique songs with specific melodic patterns and lyrics. These songs are then performed in communal ceremonies featuring singing, bamboo percussion, and trance dancing. Different song genres serve different purposes: healing illness, ensuring agricultural success, or community celebration. The song-giver maintains a relationship with the spirit who gave the song. This system creates an ever-expanding repertoire of sacred music, each song connected to personal spiritual experience and community performance.</p>

            <h2>Ceremonial Healing</h2>
            <p>Temiar healing ceremonies bring together dream-received songs, trance dancing, and spirit mediumship. When someone falls ill, healers (halaa) diagnose spiritual causes and organize ceremonies to address them. During nightlong ceremonies, participants sing, dance, and enter trance states. The healer mediates between the sick person and spirits causing illness. The collective singing creates a "cool" spiritual environment conducive to healing. Illness is understood as soul loss or spirit affliction; healing restores soul components and spiritual harmony. These ceremonies also maintain community cohesion and cultural continuity, serving social as well as medical functions in Temiar society.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Temiar</h2>
            <p>Modern Temiar face severe threats from logging, which has devastated their forest homeland. Much of traditional Temiar territory has been logged, destroying hunting grounds, sacred sites, and the forest environment central to their culture. Some Temiar communities have blockaded logging roads in resistance. The Temiar have been among the most active Orang Asli groups in land rights struggles. Relocation to government-built settlements has disrupted traditional life. Christianity (both mainstream and indigenous churches) has grown alongside traditional practices. The Temiar language remains strong in remote areas but faces Malay pressure. How the Temiar preserve their remarkable ceremonial traditions amid environmental destruction shapes their cultural future.</p>
