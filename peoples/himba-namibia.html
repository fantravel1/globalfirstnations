            <h2>Who Are the Himba?</h2>
            <p>The **Himba** are a semi-nomadic pastoralist people inhabiting the Kunene Region of northwestern Namibia and southern Angola, numbering approximately **50,000 people**. They are world-famous for the striking appearance of Himba women, who cover their skin and hair with a mixture of **butterfat and ochre** (otjize) that gives them a distinctive reddish color, protects against sun and insects, and serves as a beauty standard. Related to the Herero people (who adopted Western dress under German colonial influence), the Himba maintained traditional practices through their remote, arid homeland. They herd cattle and goats in one of Africa's harshest environments, centering their culture on the **sacred fire** (okuruwo) that links the living to their ancestors.</p>

            <h2>Otjize: The Red Ochre Tradition</h2>
            <p>Himba women spend hours daily preparing and applying **otjize**—a paste of butterfat mixed with red ochre pigment—to their skin, hair, and clothing. The deep red color has become iconic, appearing on countless photographs and documentaries. Otjize serves multiple purposes: it protects skin from the harsh desert sun and drying winds; repels insects; and maintains skin health in an environment where water is too scarce for regular washing. Beyond practicality, otjize represents Himba aesthetic ideals: the red color symbolizes blood, earth, and the red cattle that are central to Himba life. Hairstyles, also dressed with otjize, indicate age and social status—married women wear distinctive **erembe** (leather headdress) while young women have different arrangements. For Himba, this appearance is not costume but identity, maintained even as they encounter the outside world.</p>

            <h2>Cattle and Social Organization</h2>
            <p>Like many East African pastoralists, the Himba center their lives on **cattle**. Cattle represent wealth, status, and social bonds—paid as bride-price, sacrificed for ancestors, and measured in establishing a person's standing. The Himba are semi-nomadic, moving herds between seasonal pastures and water sources in their arid territory. Homesteads (**onganda**) consist of circular arrangements of huts around a central kraal where cattle are kept at night. At the homestead's heart burns the **sacred fire** (okuruwo), which must never be extinguished—it connects the living to ancestors and to **Mukuru**, the supreme being. The male head of household mediates between the living and dead through the fire. Society is organized through patrilineal clans (determining inheritance and cattle) and matrilineal clans (determining spiritual characteristics), creating complex kinship obligations.</p>

            <h2>Tourism and Cultural Change</h2>
            <p>The Himba's striking appearance has made them a major tourist attraction, with significant implications for cultural change. Tourists pay to visit villages, photograph women, and observe "traditional" life. This creates income but also concerns: are authentic practices being performed for tourists? Does payment for photographs commodify culture? Some villages have become dependent on tourism income, potentially distorting community choices. Meanwhile, modernity encroaches: some young Himba adopt Western dress, attend schools, move to towns, and question traditional practices like arranged marriage. Development projects—including a controversial proposed dam on the Kunene River—threaten traditional territories. The Himba navigate between economic opportunity and cultural preservation, between embracing the outside world and maintaining the practices that define their identity.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Challenges</h2>
            <p>The Himba face interconnected challenges. **Climate change** intensifies droughts in an already arid region, decimating cattle herds—their primary wealth. The proposed **Orokawe (Baynes) Dam** would flood ancestral lands and sacred sites. Education pulls children toward towns and away from pastoral life; health services are limited; and political marginalization limits voice in national decisions affecting their territory. Yet the Himba have proven resilient, maintaining cultural practices that many expected would disappear. Community conservancies provide some income through wildlife tourism. Advocacy organizations represent Himba interests, though with limited success. The question is whether traditional pastoralism remains viable as climate changes and development pressures intensify—or whether the Himba, like so many pastoral peoples, will be pushed toward sedentary life, losing the practices that have sustained them for centuries.</p>
