            <h2>Who Are the Kru?</h2>
            <p>The Kru are a coastal ethnic group of Liberia and Côte d'Ivoire, numbering approximately 1-1.5 million across all Kru subgroups. They speak Kru languages, a branch of the Niger-Congo family, with numerous dialects including Bassa, Grebo, and Krahn. The Kru inhabit the coast and forests of southeastern Liberia and southwestern Côte d'Ivoire. They became famous as skilled sailors and maritime laborers, working on European ships along the West African coast and beyond. Kru sailors were so valued that "Kru" became a general term for African seafarers. Their maritime heritage shaped coastal West Africa's engagement with global trade.</p>

            <h2>Maritime Tradition</h2>
            <p>Kru maritime expertise made them sought-after sailors throughout the Atlantic world. From the 16th century onward, European ships calling at West African ports recruited Kru crewmen, valued for their seamanship, swimming ability, and skill in navigating surf zones. Kru sailors worked on merchant vessels, naval ships, and even whalers. Their facial marks—a distinctive vertical line on the forehead—helped identify them and may have protected against enslavement (as their skills made them more valuable as free workers). Freetown in Sierra Leone became a major center of Kru employment. This maritime heritage created connections linking West Africa to the global economy.</p>

            <h2>Resistance to Colonialism</h2>
            <p>The Kru resisted various forms of colonial imposition. They refused incorporation into the Liberian state established by freed American slaves, fighting multiple conflicts with the Monrovia government in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The Kru viewed themselves as distinct from the Americo-Liberian settlers who dominated Liberian politics. British and French colonial authorities also faced Kru resistance along the Ivorian coast. This history of resistance shaped Kru identity and created tensions within Liberia that contributed to later civil conflicts. The Kru sought to maintain autonomy within states they had not chosen.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Kru</h2>
            <p>Modern Kru communities face the legacy of Liberia's civil wars (1989-2003), which devastated much of the country and displaced many people. Some Kru leaders participated in various factions. Post-war reconstruction has been slow, with coastal communities rebuilding livelihoods based on fishing and farming. Maritime traditions persist, though industrial shipping has largely replaced the traditional role of Kru sailors. The various Kru subgroups maintain distinct identities while sharing cultural connections. How the Kru rebuild after civil conflict, navigate Liberian national politics, and maintain cultural traditions shapes this seafaring people's future.</p>
