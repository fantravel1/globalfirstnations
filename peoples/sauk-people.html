            <h2>Who Are the Sauk?</h2>
            <p>The Sauk (Sac, Thakiwaki, meaning "people of the yellow earth") are an Algonquian-speaking people originally of the Great Lakes region who moved to the Mississippi Valley by the 18th century. Today numbering approximately 6,000-7,000, they are organized as the Sac and Fox Nation of Oklahoma, the Sac and Fox Tribe of the Mississippi in Iowa, and the Sac and Fox Nation of Missouri in Kansas and Nebraska. Closely allied with the Meskwaki (Fox) since the early 18th century, the two peoples are often grouped together as "Sac and Fox." The Sauk warrior Black Hawk became famous for leading resistance to American expansion in the 1832 Black Hawk War.</p>

            <h2>Mississippi Valley Life</h2>
            <p>By the 18th century, the Sauk had established major villages along the Mississippi and Rock Rivers, with Saukenuk (near present-day Rock Island, Illinois) becoming one of the largest Native American communities in North America—home to perhaps 6,000 people. The Sauk combined agriculture (corn, beans, squash) with seasonal hunting expeditions to the prairies. Villages featured large bark houses. Society was organized into patrilineal clans, with civil and war chiefs playing distinct roles. The alliance with the Meskwaki, dating from the Fox Wars era, created a powerful confederacy. The Sauk successfully resisted Iroquois expansion and later allied with the British against American expansion.</p>

            <h2>Black Hawk War</h2>
            <p>The 1804 Treaty of St. Louis—which Sauk leaders disputed as fraudulent—ceded tribal lands east of the Mississippi. While some Sauk accepted removal, the war leader Black Hawk (Ma-ka-tai-me-she-kia-kiak) rejected the treaty's validity. In 1832, he led approximately 1,500 Sauk, Meskwaki, and Kickapoo, including women, children, and elderly, back across the Mississippi to reclaim their homeland. The Illinois militia and U.S. Army pursued them through Wisconsin. The Black Hawk War ended in tragedy at the Bad Axe Massacre, where soldiers killed fleeing families. Black Hawk was captured and later toured Eastern cities as a celebrity prisoner. His autobiography remains a classic of Native American literature.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Sauk</h2>
            <p>Modern Sauk communities maintain cultural identity while adapting to contemporary circumstances. The Sac and Fox Nation of Oklahoma, headquartered in Stroud, operates various enterprises and maintains tribal services. Jim Thorpe—arguably the greatest athlete of the 20th century—was Sac and Fox, as is current Olympic gold medalist wrestler Helen Maroulis. The Sac and Fox Tribe of the Mississippi in Iowa includes both Sauk and Meskwaki. The Sac and Fox language, while endangered, has preservation programs. Traditional governance structures and ceremonies continue. Black Hawk remains a symbol of resistance; his famous statement "I am Sauk... I have done nothing for which an Indian ought to be ashamed" captures the dignified resistance that characterized his struggle against dispossession.</p>
