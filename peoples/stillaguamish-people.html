            <h2>Who Are the Stillaguamish?</h2>
            <p>The Stillaguamish Tribe of Indians has approximately 300 enrolled members, headquartered in Arlington, Washington. Their name derives from the Stillaguamish River, which drains the western Cascade slopes in Snohomish County. They speak Lushootseed, a Central Salish language. Unlike many Puget Sound tribes, the Stillaguamish never received a reservation under the Point Elliott Treaty of 1855—though signatories to the treaty, they were expected to consolidate with other tribes. Federal recognition came only in 1976 after lengthy litigation. This landless history shapes their contemporary situation.</p>

            <h2>Landless Tribe</h2>
            <p>The Stillaguamish signed the 1855 Point Elliott Treaty but were assigned to the Tulalip Reservation rather than receiving their own land. Many Stillaguamish refused to relocate, remaining along the Stillaguamish River and its tributaries. This created a legal limbo: treaty signatories without reservation land. The tribe maintained identity through decades without federal recognition, meeting in homes and continuing cultural practices. The 1976 recognition established them as a tribe but came with no land base. Since then, the tribe has acquired properties to serve as administrative and cultural centers.</p>

            <h2>The Stillaguamish River</h2>
            <p>The Stillaguamish River defines tribal identity. Rising in the Cascades, the river once supported enormous salmon runs; Chinook (king) salmon were particularly significant. Logging, development, and dams devastated salmon populations over the 20th century. The 2014 Oso landslide killed 43 people and dramatically altered the river's north fork. The tribe works on salmon recovery, partnering with state and federal agencies on habitat restoration. Environmental stewardship of the Stillaguamish watershed represents both cultural mandate and practical necessity for a river people whose namesake ecosystem is threatened.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Stillaguamish</h2>
            <p>Modern Stillaguamish have built capacity despite their small size and late recognition. Angel of the Winds Casino Resort generates significant revenue for tribal programs. The tribe has acquired land for administrative buildings, housing, and cultural facilities. Natural resources programs focus on salmon and watershed restoration. Language preservation works to maintain Lushootseed despite few speakers. The small membership creates challenges—resources are limited, and community size constrains program scale. How this small tribe builds institutions while preserving identity defines the river people's ongoing development.</p>
