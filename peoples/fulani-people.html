            <h2>Who Are the Fulani?</h2>
            <p>The Fulani (Fula, Fulbe, Peul) are one of the largest and most widely dispersed ethnic groups in Africa, numbering approximately 40-50 million people across the Sahel and West Africa, from Senegal to Sudan. They speak Fulfulde (Pulaar, Fula), a Niger-Congo language with numerous dialects. The Fulani are traditionally pastoral nomads, following cattle across vast distances in search of grazing land and water. Their history includes founding major Islamic states in the 18th-19th centuries (Sokoto Caliphate, Futa Jallon, Futa Toro). Today, Fulani range from fully nomadic pastoralists to settled farmers to urbanized professionals, but cattle herding remains central to Fulani cultural identity, with cattle representing wealth, status, and social bonds.</p>

            <h2>Pastoral Life</h2>
            <p>Traditional Fulani pastoralism involves transhumance—seasonal movement following rains and grazing patterns across hundreds of kilometers. The zebu cattle raised by Fulani are adapted to tropical conditions and are the foundation of social and economic life. Cattle provide milk (the dietary staple), occasionally meat, leather, and manure for trade. Wealth is measured in cattle; marriages involve cattle exchanges; social status derives from herd size. The relationship between Fulani herders and their cattle is intimate—individual animals are named, their personalities known, their lineages remembered. Herding skills, cattle knowledge, and ability to survive the harsh Sahel environment are highly valued. The pastoral Fulani developed sophisticated knowledge of grazing ecology, water sources, and animal husbandry across some of Africa's most challenging landscapes.</p>

            <h2>Cultural Values</h2>
            <p>Fulani culture is organized around the concept of pulaaku—the "Fulani way"—a moral code emphasizing restraint, dignity, and reserve. Key values include semteende (shame, modesty), munyal (patience, self-control), hakkilo (wisdom, prudence), and ngorgu (courage). Showing emotion openly, particularly negative emotions, violates pulaaku. This cultural code distinguishes "true Fulani" from others and provides standards for proper behavior. Physical beauty is valued; elaborate hairstyles, facial tattoos, and jewelry mark Fulani identity, particularly among women. The Wodaabe subgroup is famous for male beauty contests. Islam spread among Fulani from the 11th century and is now nearly universal, though syncretism with pre-Islamic practices exists. Fulani played major roles in Islamizing West Africa through jihads and scholarship.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Fulani</h2>
            <p>Modern Fulani face severe challenges. Climate change is drying the Sahel, reducing grazing land and forcing migration southward. This has intensified conflict with sedentary farmers over land and water—farmer-herder conflicts have killed thousands in Nigeria, Mali, and elsewhere. Some Fulani have been recruited by armed groups including Islamist insurgents. These conflicts have generated ethnic tensions and, in some cases, atrocities against Fulani communities. Many Fulani have been forced to abandon nomadism for settled life. Urbanization is increasing, with educated Fulani entering professions. The Fulani language and identity remain strong across their vast range. The Fulani represent both the sophistication of African pastoral systems developed over millennia and the contemporary crises affecting pastoralists globally—climate change, land pressure, and violent conflict.</p>
