            <h2>Who Are the Wounaan?</h2>
            <p>The Wounaan (also Waunan, Noanamá, or Chocó) are an indigenous people of the Darién rainforest region spanning eastern Panama and northwestern Colombia. In Panama, they number approximately 7,000-10,000, concentrated along the rivers of Darién Province and in the Emberá-Wounaan Comarca. They speak Woun Meu, a Chocoan language related to Emberá. The Wounaan are closely related to the Emberá people; both were historically grouped as "Chocó" by outsiders. Their homeland in the Darién—one of the world's most biodiverse and impenetrable rainforests—has preserved their autonomy while creating the conditions for their remarkable basketry tradition that has achieved international art-world recognition.</p>

            <h2>Tagua Nut and Cocobolo Carving</h2>
            <p>Wounaan artisans have developed world-renowned carving traditions using two distinctive materials. Tagua nuts—the "vegetable ivory" seeds of tagua palms—are carved into intricate miniature sculptures depicting forest animals, mythological figures, and everyday scenes. Cocobolo wood, a tropical hardwood with rich reddish-brown coloring, is carved into larger sculptures and decorative objects. These carving traditions, while drawing on traditional knowledge of forest materials, developed primarily in the late 20th century as commercial ventures. Today, Wounaan carvings are sold in galleries and museums internationally, providing significant income while raising questions about cultural authenticity and intellectual property.</p>

            <h2>Basketry as Fine Art</h2>
            <p>Wounaan basketry has achieved remarkable recognition in the fine art world. Woven from chunga palm fibers dyed with natural plant pigments, these baskets feature intricate geometric designs depicting animals, plants, and mythological narratives. Techniques produce pieces so tightly woven they can hold water. Beginning in the 1980s, collectors and galleries began marketing Wounaan baskets as fine art rather than craft. Prices for exceptional pieces can reach thousands of dollars. Museums including the Smithsonian have collected Wounaan baskets. This success has transformed village economies but also created pressures: master weavers are in demand; younger women must choose between traditional skills and formal education; market demands may influence design choices.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Wounaan</h2>
            <p>Modern Wounaan live in riverine communities in the Darién and in the Emberá-Wounaan Comarca established in 1983. This semi-autonomous territory provides legal protection but encompasses only part of traditional lands. Many Wounaan have relocated to Panama City, establishing urban communities while maintaining ties to homeland villages. The Darién Gap—the only break in the Pan-American Highway—has protected Wounaan territory but also limited development; debates about completing the highway would dramatically transform the region. Deforestation, mining, and drug trafficking threaten the Darién environment. Colombian conflict has pushed refugees through Wounaan territory. The success of Wounaan art has provided economic alternatives to environmentally destructive activities while raising complex questions about development, tradition, and indigenous futures in a rapidly changing world.</p>
