            <h2>Who Are the Kharia?</h2>
            <p>The Kharia are an indigenous tribal people of eastern India, primarily inhabiting Jharkhand, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, and West Bengal states. Numbering approximately 500,000-600,000, they are one of the larger Munda-speaking groups. The Kharia speak Kharia, a North Munda language of the Austroasiatic family. Three main subgroups exist: the Dudh Kharia (associated with settled agriculture), Dhelki Kharia (traditionally associated with iron smelting and metalwork), and Paharia or Hill Kharia (associated with hill dwelling and hunting-gathering). This diversity reflects different historical adaptations and occupational specializations within the broader Kharia identity. The Kharia have experienced significant social change, including religious conversion and labor migration.</p>

            <h2>Iron Tradition</h2>
            <p>The Dhelki Kharia subgroup maintained traditions of iron smelting and metalworking, producing tools, weapons, and implements for local use. Indigenous iron smelting in India dates back millennia, and Munda-speaking peoples were among its practitioners. Smelters extracted iron from locally available ore, producing blooms that were forged into finished products. This technical knowledge gave the Kharia economic importance in regional networks. While industrial iron production has largely replaced traditional smelting, the heritage of metalworking remains part of Kharia identity. Agricultural tools, knives, and other implements were traded with neighboring communities, establishing the Kharia as important producers in the regional economy.</p>

            <h2>Religious Change</h2>
            <p>The Kharia have experienced significant religious transformation. Traditional religion (Sarna) focused on nature spirits, ancestor veneration, and village deities. Christian missionaries, particularly Catholics and Lutherans, achieved significant conversions beginning in the 19th century; perhaps 40-50% of Kharia are now Christian. This religious change has influenced education (mission schools were often first to serve tribal areas), social reform (challenges to alcohol use and some traditional practices), and political orientation (Christian Kharia have sometimes organized distinctly from Hindu nationalist frameworks). Religious diversity within the Kharia community creates different orientations toward tradition and modernity, with both Christian and Sarna-practicing Kharia asserting authentic Kharia identity.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Kharia</h2>
            <p>Modern Kharia face the common challenges of India's scheduled tribes: landlessness, poverty, and limited access to education and health services. Many Kharia have migrated for labor, particularly to tea plantations in Assam and Bengal, where Kharia communities have lived for generations. Urban migration for construction, domestic, and informal sector work is increasing. In home areas, agriculture remains important, though landholdings are often small. Mining and industrial development in the Chotanagpur plateau have displaced some communities while providing employment for others. Education rates are improving; some Kharia have achieved professional positions. Political organization includes participation in broader tribal movements advocating for scheduled tribe rights and regional autonomy.</p>
