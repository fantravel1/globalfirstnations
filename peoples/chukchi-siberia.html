            <h2>Who Are the Chukchi?</h2>
            <p>The Chukchi are an indigenous people of northeastern Siberia, numbering approximately 16,000 in Russia's Chukotka Autonomous Okrug—the closest point to North America (82 km from Alaska across the Bering Strait). They speak Chukchi, a Chukotko-Kamchatkan language. The Chukchi are divided into maritime (coastal whale and seal hunters) and reindeer (tundra herders) groups with distinct but interconnected cultures. Uniquely among Siberian peoples, the Chukchi successfully resisted Russian conquest for over a century; they were never fully subjugated, eventually incorporated through trade rather than force. This fierce independence marks Chukchi identity.</p>

            <h2>Resistance to Russia</h2>
            <p>The Chukchi were the only Siberian people to successfully resist Russian conquest. Wars between 1729-1764 saw Chukchi warriors defeat Russian forces repeatedly; a 1747 battle killed the Russian commander and most of his force. The Chukchi used guerrilla tactics, mobility, and armor made from walrus hide and bone. Eventually, Russia abandoned conquest, establishing trade relations instead. This history of martial success and independence is central to Chukchi identity—contrasting with the colonization experience of other Siberian peoples. Even Soviet collectivization faced resistance; full control over Chukchi herders took decades.</p>

            <h2>Walrus and Whale Hunting</h2>
            <p>Maritime Chukchi developed sophisticated Arctic marine mammal hunting—pursuing walrus, seals, and whales from skin boats (baidara). Walrus provided meat, blubber (fuel and food), hide (for boats and rope), and ivory (for tools and trade). Whale hunting required cooperative village efforts; successful hunts provided enormous resources. Knowledge of ice, currents, and animal behavior accumulated over millennia. Soviet and Russian regulations disrupted traditional hunting; some restrictions remain. Today, maritime Chukchi continue subsistence hunting while navigating regulations, climate change affecting ice conditions, and competition for marine resources.</p>

            <h2>Yaranga and Adaptation</h2>
            <p>The yaranga is the traditional Chukchi dwelling—a large tent of reindeer or walrus skin stretched over a wooden frame, with an inner heated sleeping compartment (polog). Reindeer Chukchi moved yarangas seasonally following herds; maritime Chukchi maintained semi-permanent coastal villages. The yaranga demonstrates Arctic adaptation: insulation principles similar to igloos, flexible structure suited to mobile life, materials derived from local resources. Soviet policies promoted settlement in permanent villages, disrupting traditional mobility. Some families maintain yarangas for herding camps; the dwelling remains a symbol of Chukchi identity and adaptation.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Chukchi</h2>
            <p>Post-Soviet collapse devastated Chukotka's economy—state farms closed, populations declined, subsidies ended. Mining (gold, other minerals) provides limited employment. Many Chukchi live in poverty despite resource extraction. Traditional herding and hunting continue but face climate change challenges: shifting ice, changing animal distributions, unpredictable weather. Roman Abramovich's governorship (2000-2008) brought investment but also controversy. Language shift toward Russian threatens Chukchi; education efforts attempt revitalization. How Chukchi navigate economic marginalization, climate change, and cultural preservation in Russia's remote northeast defines their contemporary challenges.</p>
