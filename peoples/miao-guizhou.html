            <h2>Who Are the Miao?</h2>
            <p>The Miao (known internationally as Hmong in Southeast Asia) are one of China's largest ethnic minorities, with the greatest concentration living in Guizhou Province's mountainous regions. Over 9 million Miao live in China, with distinct subgroups differentiated by their costumes, dialects, and customs—including the Black Miao, Flowery Miao, White Miao, and many others.</p>
            <p>Their ancestors are believed to have originated in the Yellow River valley before migrating south over centuries, eventually settling in the remote karst mountains of Guizhou, Yunnan, and neighboring provinces. This geographic isolation helped preserve their distinctive culture, including an ancient tradition of recording history through textile patterns rather than written language.</p>

            <h2>Silver Artistry</h2>
            <p>The Miao are renowned worldwide for their spectacular silver jewelry, which represents both extraordinary craftsmanship and cultural identity. Women wear elaborate silver headdresses, neck rings, bracelets, and ornaments weighing up to 15 kilograms during festivals. The silver serves multiple purposes: displaying family wealth, protecting against evil spirits, and preserving cultural symbols.</p>
            <p>Each piece tells a story through intricate motifs—butterflies, dragons, phoenixes, flowers, and fish all carry specific meanings related to Miao cosmology and history. The silversmithing tradition is passed from father to son, with some families maintaining continuous practice for generations. Villages like Kongbai are famous for their silver workshops where artisans use ancient techniques.</p>

            <h2>Embroidered History</h2>
            <p>Without a traditional written language, the Miao developed elaborate systems of encoding history, mythology, and identity in textile patterns. Girls begin learning embroidery from their mothers at age seven or eight, eventually creating their own costumes over years of painstaking work. The resulting garments are wearable histories, with patterns commemorating ancestral migrations, legendary heroes, and creation stories.</p>
            <p>Different Miao subgroups are identified by distinctive embroidery styles, colors, and costume designs. The intricate cross-stitch, appliqué, and batik techniques produce works of stunning complexity. Some ceremonial garments require years to complete and are treasured as family heirlooms passed through generations.</p>

            <h2>The Lusheng and Music</h2>
            <p>The lusheng, a mouth organ made of bamboo pipes, is the Miao's most iconic musical instrument. Lusheng festivals draw thousands of participants who perform circular dances while playing these instruments, creating a hypnotic wall of sound. The largest festivals feature competitions between villages, with musicians playing instruments up to four meters tall.</p>
            <p>Traditional songs preserve oral histories, including epic narratives of migration and the legend of "Crossing the Great River" that recalls ancestral journeys. Love songs, funeral laments, and drinking songs each follow specific melodic patterns. The polyphonic singing tradition of the Grand Song has been recognized by UNESCO.</p>

            <h2>Sisters' Meal Festival</h2>
            <p>The Sisters' Meal Festival, held annually in Guizhou, is one of the most colorful events in China. Young women in full silver regalia prepare dyed glutinous rice in colors symbolizing different messages—a hidden pine needle indicates reciprocated love, while chopsticks suggest marriage. The festival has ancient roots in courtship traditions but now draws tourists from around the world.</p>
