            <h2>Who Are the Circassians?</h2>
            <p>The Circassians (self-name: Adyghe) are a Northwest Caucasian people originally from the northwestern Caucasus region between the Black Sea and Caspian. Historically numbering over 2 million, the Russian-Circassian War (1763-1864) and subsequent genocide/expulsion killed hundreds of thousands and exiled up to 90% of survivors to the Ottoman Empire. Today, approximately 4 million Circassians live in diaspora (mainly Turkey, Jordan, Syria, Israel), while only 700,000 remain in Russia (across Adygea, Kabardino-Balkaria, and Karachay-Cherkessia). They speak Circassian languages and are known for their warrior traditions, hospitality code, and the tragic history of genocide.</p>

            <h2>The Genocide</h2>
            <p>The Russian-Circassian War (1763-1864) culminated in what scholars increasingly recognize as genocide. Russia sought to clear the northwestern Caucasus of indigenous population; military campaigns burned villages, destroyed crops, and massacred civilians. After the final defeat (1864), Russia systematically expelled survivors—hundreds of thousands were forced to Ottoman territories in brutal deportations; many died en route. The total death toll is debated but may exceed 1 million; contemporary Circassians seek genocide recognition (currently recognized by Georgia, not Russia). May 21, 1864—the date marking the end of resistance—is commemorated as a day of mourning.</p>

            <h2>Adyghe Xabze</h2>
            <p>Adyghe Xabze is the traditional Circassian ethical and behavioral code governing all aspects of life—hospitality, honor, respect for elders, gender relations, conflict resolution. Hospitality is paramount: guests are sacred, entitled to protection even at cost to the host. The code emphasizes restraint, dignity, and proper conduct in all situations. Warriors followed strict honor codes in battle. Xabze governed traditional society before Islam (most Circassians converted in the 17th-18th centuries); many elements persist as cultural identity distinct from religious practice. The code represents sophisticated indigenous ethics and social organization.</p>

            <h2>Diaspora Communities</h2>
            <p>Turkey hosts the largest Circassian diaspora (perhaps 2-5 million of Circassian descent, though exact numbers are disputed given assimilation). Jordan's Circassians, though numbering only 100,000+, have disproportionate influence—serving as royal guards and prominent citizens. Syrian Circassians faced displacement in the civil war. Israeli Circassians (Kfar Kama and Rehaniya villages) serve in the IDF. Diaspora communities maintain dance ensembles, language schools, and cultural associations while facing assimilation pressures. The desire for homeland return remains strong; some diaspora members have emigrated to Russia, though adaptation proves difficult.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Circassians</h2>
            <p>In Russia, Circassians exist in three republics but remain minorities except in Adygea (25%). Language transmission declines despite official status; Russian dominates education and public life. The 2014 Sochi Olympics controversy—held on genocide sites—mobilized diaspora activism but achieved limited Russian acknowledgment. In Turkey, Circassian identity revival contrasts with decades of assimilation policy. Genocide recognition campaigns continue, building on the Armenian precedent. How Circassians preserve language and culture across scattered communities, achieve historical justice, and maintain identity without territorial concentration defines their transnational challenges.</p>
