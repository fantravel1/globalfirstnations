            <h2>Who Are the Niueans?</h2>
            <p>The Niueans are the indigenous Polynesian people of Niue, a self-governing state in free association with New Zealand. The island population is approximately 1,600-1,900, while over 20,000 Niueans live in New Zealand. They speak Niuean, a Polynesian language closely related to Tongan and Samoan. Niue is a raised coral atoll—the world's largest—nicknamed "the Rock of Polynesia." Captain Cook called it "Savage Island" after unsuccessful landing attempts. Niue's unique ecology and isolation produced a distinctive culture. The island's challenging environment—limited soil, no streams—shaped a resilient people whose diaspora now far outnumbers those remaining on the rock.</p>

            <h2>The Raised Atoll</h2>
            <p>Niue's geology makes it unique among Pacific islands. Rather than a volcanic peak or low coral atoll, Niue is a raised coral platform—an ancient atoll lifted above sea level by tectonic forces. This creates a distinctive landscape: a rocky plateau with thin soil, cliffs plunging to the sea, and an extensive cave system. No rivers or streams exist; fresh water comes from underground lenses. Agriculture is limited by thin soil. The sea provides fish, but the lack of a protected lagoon makes fishing challenging. This harsh environment kept population low and shaped cultural adaptations, including food preservation techniques and cooperative subsistence strategies.</p>

            <h2>Diaspora Nation</h2>
            <p>Niue presents a remarkable demographic situation: more Niueans live abroad than on the island. Approximately 22,000 Niueans and their descendants reside in New Zealand, compared to fewer than 2,000 on Niue itself. This emigration, accelerating since the 1970s, reflects limited economic opportunities on the remote island. Cyclone Heta (2004) devastated the island, accelerating departure. The remaining population is aging. Yet Niueans abroad maintain strong ties to the homeland, returning for holidays and family events. The Niuean government grapples with how to sustain the island while its population resides elsewhere. This diaspora pattern raises questions about what constitutes a viable nation.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Niue</h2>
            <p>Modern Niue relies heavily on financial support from New Zealand, remittances from the diaspora, and limited tourism. The island has embraced some innovative approaches: it was the first nation to offer free nationwide WiFi and has sold its internet domain (.nu) for revenue. Conservation initiatives protect marine areas. However, population decline threatens viability—schools have closed, services are limited. Those who remain maintain traditional practices including taro cultivation, fishing, and village life. Whether Niue can sustain a viable resident population or will become primarily a diaspora homeland visited seasonally shapes this Rock of Polynesia's existential future.</p>
