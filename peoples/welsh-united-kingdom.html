            <h2>Who Are the Welsh?</h2>
            <p>The Welsh (Cymry in Welsh, meaning "fellow countrymen") are the people of Wales, numbering approximately 3.1 million in Wales plus significant diaspora. They speak Welsh (Cymraeg), the most widely spoken Celtic language today, with about 900,000 speakers. The Welsh descend from the Britons who inhabited Britain before and during Roman occupation; pushed westward by Anglo-Saxon invasions, they maintained distinct identity in the mountains of Wales. Welsh literature (including the Mabinogion, medieval tales of heroes and magic) represents one of Europe's oldest vernacular traditions. Devolution (1999) created the Senedd (Welsh Parliament), strengthening Welsh political identity.</p>

            <h2>Celtic Heritage</h2>
            <p>Welsh identity connects to Celtic heritage—the pre-Roman peoples of Britain. The Welsh language descends from Brittonic Celtic; Welsh shares roots with Breton, Cornish, and extinct Cumbric. Medieval Welsh poets traced ancestry to legendary Britons who resisted Romans and Saxons. The Mabinogion preserves Celtic mythology—tales of magical transformation, heroic quests, and otherworld journeys. King Arthur, though appropriated by English tradition, has Welsh origins. This Celtic consciousness distinguishes Welsh from English identity; pan-Celtic connections link Wales to Ireland, Scotland, Brittany, Cornwall, and Galicia culturally if not politically.</p>

            <h2>Language Survival</h2>
            <p>Welsh survived despite centuries of pressure. Edward I's conquest (1282) began English domination; the Acts of Union (1536-1543) imposed English administration. The "Welsh Not"—punishing schoolchildren for speaking Welsh—represents cultural suppression. Yet Welsh survived through chapel culture, eisteddfodau (cultural festivals), and rural communities. The 20th century brought revitalization: Welsh-medium schools, S4C (Welsh-language TV channel), road signs, and official status. The 2011 census showed 19% Welsh-speaking; efforts aim to reach 1 million speakers by 2050. This revival demonstrates how minority languages can recover with political will and community commitment.</p>

            <h2>Music and Culture</h2>
            <p>Wales is famous as "Land of Song." Male voice choirs, emerging from industrial communities, became Welsh symbols. Eisteddfodau—competitive festivals of poetry, music, and arts—celebrate Welsh language and culture; the National Eisteddfod is Wales' largest cultural festival. Choral singing, harp music, and cerdd dant (vocal music over harp) represent traditional forms. Rugby union is nearly a national religion; matches against England carry particular intensity. Welsh identity markers—the red dragon flag, daffodils and leeks, St. David's Day (March 1)—maintain distinctiveness within the United Kingdom.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Wales</h2>
            <p>Modern Wales has devolved government—the Senedd (Welsh Parliament) controls education, health, and other areas, though powers are less than Scotland's. Welsh-medium education has expanded dramatically; young people increasingly speak Welsh. Economic challenges persist—post-industrial communities in South Wales struggle; North Wales depends on tourism. Independence sentiment has grown, though support remains lower than in Scotland. How Wales develops its distinct voice within (or potentially outside) the United Kingdom, and whether the Welsh language achieves its million-speaker goal, shapes contemporary Welsh identity. The revival of Welsh represents one of Europe's most successful language revitalization stories.</p>
