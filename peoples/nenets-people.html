            <h2>Who Are the Nenets?</h2>
            <p>The Nenets are an indigenous Samoyedic people of the Russian Arctic, numbering approximately 45,000 and inhabiting the vast tundra and taiga regions from the Kanin Peninsula to the Taimyr Peninsula—a distance of over 2,000 kilometers. They speak Nenets, a Samoyedic language of the Uralic family, with two main dialects: Tundra Nenets and Forest Nenets. The Nenets are among the world's last truly nomadic peoples, continuing large-scale reindeer herding that involves annual migrations of hundreds of kilometers across the Arctic tundra. Their herding economy represents one of the most successful human adaptations to the extreme Arctic environment.</p>

            <h2>Reindeer Herding</h2>
            <p>Nenets reindeer herding is not simply an economic activity but a complete way of life. Families migrate with their herds—some numbering thousands of animals—following traditional routes between summer pastures on the Arctic coast and winter ranges in the taiga. Annual migration distances can exceed 1,000 kilometers. The Nenets developed sophisticated techniques for managing large herds, using reindeer-drawn sleds (narta), lassoing, and trained reindeer for transportation. The conical tent (chum or mya) provides shelter—a portable home covered with reindeer hides in winter, lighter materials in summer. Reindeer provide transportation, food, clothing, tent coverings, and trade goods. This herding system, maintained for centuries, represents the largest nomadic economy in the modern world.</p>

            <h2>Soviet Era and Aftermath</h2>
            <p>Soviet policies dramatically impacted Nenets life. Collectivization in the 1930s forced herders into state farms (sovkhozy), though the system still required nomadic herding. Children were sent to boarding schools, separating them from nomadic life and traditional knowledge transmission. Settlement policies moved families to villages. Yet Nenets herding proved necessary for Arctic meat production, and the system survived better than many indigenous practices. The Soviet collapse brought new challenges—state farm systems dissolved, markets disappeared, and many herders lost reindeer. Post-Soviet decades saw privatization and the emergence of both successful private herders and impoverished former herders who lost their animals.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Nenets</h2>
            <p>Today's Nenets face the dual challenges of industrial development and climate change. The Yamal Peninsula, heart of Nenets territory, contains vast natural gas reserves; pipelines, roads, and industrial facilities increasingly fragment migration routes. Some herders have adapted, working with gas companies; others resist development. Climate change affects tundra ecosystems—unusual warm spells cause rain-on-snow events that ice over vegetation, starving reindeer. Permafrost thaw damages pastures. Yet thousands of Nenets continue nomadic herding, demonstrating remarkable persistence. The Nenets language remains strong among herders. Documentary films have brought international attention to Nenets culture. The Nenets show how traditional lifeways can persist into the 21st century while facing unprecedented environmental and industrial pressures.</p>
