            <h2>Who Are the Canela?</h2>
            <p>The Canela are a Timbira (Jê-speaking) indigenous people of Maranhão state in northeastern Brazil. The term "Canela" encompasses two distinct but related groups: the Ramkokamekra (approximately 2,500 people) and the Apanyekra (approximately 800 people), living in separate territories in the cerrado region. Like other Timbira peoples, the Canela are known for their circular village layout, elaborate age-set and moiety systems, log racing ceremonies, and detailed ethnographic documentation—the Ramkokamekra were studied intensively by anthropologist William Crocker for over 60 years, making them one of the world's best-documented indigenous societies.</p>

            <h2>Age Sets and Moieties</h2>
            <p>Canela social organization exemplifies Timbira complexity. Society is organized by overlapping principles: patrilineal moieties divide the village into two halves for ceremonies; matrilineal moieties organize other activities; age sets (groups of males initiated together) create solidarity across kinship lines. Men progress through named age grades from youth through elderhood. The central plaza hosts the men's council, where political decisions are made by elders. Women's households form the residential core; men circulate between natal households, wives' households, and the plaza. This intricate organization creates multiple cross-cutting social bonds, ensuring community cohesion while allowing individual mobility.</p>

            <h2>Crocker's Documentation</h2>
            <p>The Ramkokamekra-Canela are exceptionally well documented due to William Crocker's research from 1957 until his death in 2020. Crocker conducted fieldwork over six decades, producing thousands of pages of notes, photographs, films, and publications. His work recorded ceremonial cycles, personal histories, and cultural changes with unprecedented detail. The Smithsonian Institution holds this archive. This documentation creates unique possibilities: the Canela themselves can access historical records of ceremonies, songs, and knowledge; researchers can study cultural change over generations. The Canela-Crocker relationship also raises questions about long-term anthropological engagement, community benefits from research, and cultural representation.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Canela</h2>
            <p>Modern Canela communities face the challenges common to Brazilian indigenous peoples: territorial pressure from surrounding cattle ranchers, environmental degradation, limited economic opportunities, and youth emigration. Yet ceremonial life remains robust; the annual festival cycle continues with log races, initiations, and seasonal rituals. Language maintenance is relatively strong. The Canela have embraced education while maintaining distinctive identity. Political organization combines traditional council leadership with engagement in indigenous rights movements. Healthcare and sustainable development projects address community needs. The extensive ethnographic documentation provides resources for cultural revitalization—the Canela can study their own historical practices through Crocker's records, creating unusual possibilities for intentional cultural continuity.</p>
