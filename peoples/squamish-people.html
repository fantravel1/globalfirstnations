            <h2>Who Are the Squamish?</h2>
            <p>The Squamish (Sḵwx̱wú7mesh) are a Coast Salish First Nation of the Burrard Inlet, Howe Sound, and Squamish River watershed region in southwestern British Columbia, Canada—including lands now occupied by North and West Vancouver and the world-famous resort of Whistler. Numbering approximately 4,000-4,500, they speak Sḵwx̱wú7mesh sníchim (Squamish), a Salishan language. Their traditional territory encompasses some of British Columbia's most valuable real estate, making the Squamish unique among First Nations for urban land holdings that have generated significant economic opportunities while raising complex questions about development and cultural preservation.</p>

            <h2>Urban Territory</h2>
            <p>Unlike most First Nations, whose reserves are rural and remote, the Squamish hold reserves in the heart of metropolitan Vancouver—one of North America's most expensive real estate markets. Reserves in North Vancouver and West Vancouver, tiny by rural standards, are worth billions. This positioning, resulting from colonial land allocations that inadvertently placed Squamish communities in what became urban areas, has created unique opportunities and challenges. The Squamish have leveraged land values for economic development while facing pressures to surrender land or accommodate development. The contrast between reserve land and surrounding wealthy neighborhoods highlights ongoing colonial inequities.</p>

            <h2>Development and Sovereignty</h2>
            <p>The Squamish have pursued economic development while asserting sovereignty. Major projects include Senakw, a proposed 6,000-unit rental housing development in Vancouver that, because it's on reserve land, does not require city approval—a dramatic assertion of jurisdiction. This project could generate hundreds of millions in revenue while addressing Vancouver's housing crisis. Other ventures include commercial developments, partnerships, and cultural tourism. The Squamish approach demonstrates how First Nations can use urban land strategically. However, development raises internal debates about balancing economic benefit against cultural and environmental values. How does a Nation maintain identity while participating in metropolitan real estate development?</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Squamish</h2>
            <p>Modern Squamish live across their traditional territory, including reserves in North Vancouver, West Vancouver, and up Howe Sound to Squamish and beyond. The Squamish Nation government provides services and represents community interests. Treaty negotiations with Canada continue. The Squamish language is endangered; perhaps 10-15 fluent speakers remain, though revitalization programs teach younger generations. Cultural practices including potlatches, canoe journeys, and traditional arts continue. The 2010 Winter Olympics, held partly on Squamish territory, brought both recognition and controversy. Environmental advocacy, particularly regarding pipelines and tanker traffic, has engaged Squamish activism. The Squamish demonstrate how urban-situated First Nations can leverage economic position while maintaining cultural identity and political sovereignty.</p>
