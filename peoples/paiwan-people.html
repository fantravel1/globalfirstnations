            <h2>Who Are the Paiwan?</h2>
            <p>The Paiwan (排灣族) are Taiwan's second-largest indigenous group, numbering approximately 100,000-110,000 people. They speak Paiwan, a Formosan language with several dialects. The Paiwan traditionally inhabited southern Taiwan, particularly the southern Central Mountain Range and adjacent foothills, extending to the southern tip of the island. Paiwan society was hierarchically organized into noble and commoner classes, with chieftains holding political and ritual authority. They are renowned for their sophisticated stone slab architecture, intricate woodcarving, and the prominent place of the hundred-pace viper (Deinagkistrodon acutus) in their cultural symbolism and origin myths.</p>

            <h2>The Hundred-Pace Snake</h2>
            <p>The hundred-pace viper (vurung in Paiwan) holds unique significance in Paiwan culture. Origin myths describe noble lineages descending from the snake or from eggs protected by the snake. The snake pattern (a triangular geometric design) appears throughout Paiwan material culture—on textiles, carvings, ceramics, and architecture. Only nobles traditionally had the right to display snake imagery. The snake represents the connection between the Paiwan and their ancestral homeland. This cultural significance has survived into the present; the snake pattern has become a pan-Paiwan symbol appearing in contemporary art, crafts, and cultural representations.</p>

            <h2>Stone Slab Architecture</h2>
            <p>Paiwan villages feature distinctive stone slab architecture using locally available slate. Houses were built with stone walls and stone slab roofs, some incorporating carved stone pillars and lintels. The chief's house was largest and most elaborately decorated, featuring carved wooden posts depicting human figures, snakes, and geometric designs. Stone platforms served as gathering places. This architectural tradition reflected the mountainous environment with abundant slate and created cool, durable dwellings. Traditional stone slab houses are now recognized as cultural heritage, with some villages preserving or reconstructing them for cultural tourism and education.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Paiwan</h2>
            <p>Modern Paiwan balance tradition with contemporary life. The hierarchical social structure has moderated but retains cultural significance. Many Paiwan have migrated to urban areas for employment, though ties to ancestral villages remain strong. Traditional crafts—woodcarving, beadwork, and textile weaving—continue and have achieved recognition as indigenous art. The Maljeveq (five-year ceremony) maintains ritual significance. Paiwan language faces pressure from Mandarin, with revitalization efforts ongoing. Some Paiwan have achieved national prominence in art and music. How the Paiwan maintain their distinctive cultural identity—including snake symbolism and hierarchical traditions—while navigating modernity shapes this southern Taiwan people's future.</p>
