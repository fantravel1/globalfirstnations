            <h2>Who Are the Iban?</h2>
            <p>The Iban are the largest indigenous group in Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo, and one of the major Dayak peoples of the island. Numbering approximately 700,000-750,000, they inhabit the river systems of Sarawak and adjacent areas of West Kalimantan, Indonesia. The Iban speak Iban, an Austronesian language closely related to Malay. Historically known as "Sea Dayak" (distinguishing them from interior "Land Dayak" peoples), the Iban gained a formidable reputation as headhunters and warriors. Their longhouse (rumah panjai) communities, elaborate textiles (pua kumbu), and rich oral traditions have made them one of Southeast Asia's most studied indigenous peoples.</p>

            <h2>Headhunting and Warfare</h2>
            <p>Iban headhunting was integral to traditional society, though it ended under colonial rule. Taking heads was essential for young men's status, for marriage eligibility, and for spiritual power. Heads were believed to contain life force; captured heads brought prosperity to the longhouse. Headhunting raids extended Iban territory throughout Sarawak's river systems; neighboring peoples feared Iban expansion. The elaborate rituals surrounding headhunting—war preparations, head treatment, and victory celebrations—are extensively documented. The white rajahs of Sarawak (Brooke dynasty) suppressed headhunting from the mid-19th century, recruiting Iban as allies and police. During World War II, Iban scouts served with British forces, briefly reviving headhunting against Japanese occupiers. Today, ancestral heads remain in some longhouses as sacred objects.</p>

            <h2>Longhouse Life</h2>
            <p>The longhouse (rumah panjai) is central to Iban identity. These structures house entire communities—sometimes hundreds of people—under one roof. Each family has a private apartment (bilik) opening onto a common gallery (ruai) used for social activities and ceremonies. The longhouse chief (tuai rumah) coordinates community affairs but lacks coercive authority. Longhouse society features relative egalitarianism, with status achieved through accomplishments (farming success, weaving skill, formerly headhunting) rather than inherited. Rice cultivation, supplemented by hunting, fishing, and gathering, sustained traditional economy. The Gawai Dayak festival (June 1-2), a harvest celebration, is now a public holiday in Sarawak. Longhouse architecture has evolved; many are now built with modern materials, but the social structure persists.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Iban</h2>
            <p>Modern Iban have significantly integrated into Malaysian society while maintaining distinct identity. Education has expanded dramatically; Iban professionals work throughout Malaysia. Christianity (both Catholic and Protestant) has spread widely, though traditional beliefs often persist alongside. Many Iban have urbanized; Kuching and other cities have significant Iban populations. Logging and palm oil plantations have transformed traditional territories, generating economic benefits but also environmental concerns and land disputes. Native Customary Rights (NCR) land claims have become politically contentious. Iban political participation has grown; Iban politicians hold significant positions in Sarawak. The Iban language remains vital; Iban media exists; cultural festivals are celebrated. The Iban demonstrate how indigenous peoples can achieve economic and political integration while maintaining cultural distinctiveness.</p>
