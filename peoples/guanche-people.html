            <h2>Who Were the Guanche?</h2>
            <p>The Guanche were the indigenous Berber people of the Canary Islands, a volcanic archipelago in the Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of Africa. Arriving from North Africa sometime between 1000 BCE and 100 BCE, they developed distinct cultures on each island, isolated from the mainland for over a millennium. The term "Guanche" originally referred to Tenerife's inhabitants but is now applied broadly to all Canarian aboriginals. By the time of Spanish conquest (1402-1496), perhaps 60,000-100,000 Guanche inhabited the islands. Their language is extinct, though Guanche words survive in Canarian Spanish, and genetic studies show substantial Guanche ancestry in modern Canarians.</p>

            <h2>Island Isolation</h2>
            <p>The Guanche arrived in the Canaries with Berber language, goats, pigs, barley, and wheat, but apparently lost maritime technology—they could not travel between islands, resulting in each island's population developing separately for over a millennium. This isolation produced remarkable cultural diversity across the seven main islands: different dialects, different social structures (some islands had kings, others councils), different subsistence strategies adapted to each island's ecology. Gran Canaria developed complex irrigation; Tenerife's Guanche built stone-walled settlements; Lanzarote's adapted to extreme aridity. The isolation also preserved genetic and cultural features that had changed on mainland North Africa, making the Guanche invaluable for understanding ancient Berber populations.</p>

            <h2>Conquest and Legacy</h2>
            <p>Spanish conquest of the Canaries (1402-1496) preceded Columbus's voyage and served as prototype for later American conquests. Guanche resistance varied by island; Tenerife held out until 1496. Conquest methods included warfare, enslavement, forced conversion, and exploitation of internal divisions. Post-conquest, the Guanche population collapsed from disease, enslavement, and displacement; survivors intermarried with Spanish settlers and enslaved Africans. By the 17th century, Guanche language and distinct identity had essentially disappeared. However, genetic studies show modern Canarians carry substantial Guanche ancestry (perhaps 15-25% maternally). Place names, words in Canarian Spanish, and cultural practices preserve Guanche heritage. Mummies found in caves have provided DNA and anthropological data about pre-conquest populations.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Heritage</h2>
            <p>Today, the Guanche represent a heritage rather than a living community. Archaeological sites, museums, and cultural programs preserve and present Guanche history. The Canarian government has invested in Guanche heritage as part of regional identity, distinct from mainland Spain. Some Canarians embrace Guanche ancestry as a source of local identity; neo-Guanche movements have emerged promoting indigenism. However, there is no Guanche language revival (too little is known), and claims of Guanche cultural continuity are contested. The Guanche case illustrates both the destruction colonialism inflicts on indigenous peoples and how heritage can be reconstructed centuries later—the Guanche are absent yet present, their DNA and words surviving in descendants who have reclaimed their memory.</p>
