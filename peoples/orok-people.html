            <h2>Who Are the Orok?</h2>
            <p>The Orok, also known as Uilta, are a small Tungusic people of Sakhalin Island in the Russian Far East, numbering only 300-400 people—one of Russia's smallest indigenous populations. They speak Orok (Uilta), a Tungusic language critically endangered with perhaps 30-50 speakers remaining. The Orok are unique among Sakhalin's indigenous peoples for practicing reindeer herding, likely brought to the island from the mainland centuries ago. Their traditional territory on northern and central Sakhalin has been dramatically affected by oil and gas development. The Orok represent a small but distinctive people combining maritime and reindeer herding traditions in an island environment.</p>

            <h2>Island Reindeer Herders</h2>
            <p>The Orok developed a unique adaptation combining reindeer herding with fishing and sea mammal hunting. While the neighboring Nivkh relied entirely on fishing and hunting, the Orok maintained small reindeer herds that provided transportation, meat, and hides. Sakhalin's climate limited herd size; most Orok families maintained only 10-50 animals. Reindeer were used primarily for transport—packing loads through the taiga and riding during seasonal migrations. The Orok followed a nomadic cycle through the island's forests, moving between fishing camps, hunting grounds, and reindeer pastures. This combination of economies provided resilience; when fishing failed, reindeer sustained the community, and vice versa. The Japanese colonial period (1905-1945) disrupted traditional patterns as the Orok territory was divided between Russian and Japanese administration.</p>

            <h2>Divided History</h2>
            <p>The Orok experienced unique historical trauma as their island was divided between Russia and Japan multiple times. Some Orok lived under Japanese administration from 1905-1945; when Japan surrendered Sakhalin to the Soviet Union after World War II, the Japanese-administered Orok faced Soviet suspicion. Some Orok were deported to Japan along with Japanese settlers, separating families and communities. Those remaining in the Soviet Union faced collectivization and sedentarization. Reindeer herding was reorganized into state farms; traditional nomadism ended. The small population size made cultural transmission extremely difficult. By the late Soviet period, traditional knowledge and language were rapidly disappearing.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Orok</h2>
            <p>Modern Orok live primarily in a few settlements on northern Sakhalin. Oil and gas development (including the Sakhalin-2 project) has dramatically affected Orok territories; pipelines and infrastructure cross traditional lands. Some Orok families received compensation; others continue to fight for recognition of their rights. The Orok language is moribund; perhaps 30 elderly speakers remain. Cultural revival efforts include language documentation, attempts to revive reindeer herding, and legal advocacy for indigenous rights. The Association of Sakhalin Indigenous Peoples advocates for Orok and Nivkh interests. The Orok demonstrate both the vulnerability of very small indigenous populations and the persistence of cultural identity despite overwhelming pressures. Their future remains uncertain as their homeland transforms through industrial development.</p>
