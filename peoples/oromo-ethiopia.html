            <h2>Who Are the Oromo?</h2>
            <p>The Oromo are the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia and one of Africa's largest nations, numbering approximately 40 million (over 35% of Ethiopia's population), with additional communities in Kenya. They speak Afaan Oromoo (Oromo), a Cushitic language of the Afroasiatic family. The Oromo developed a unique democratic governance system called Gadaa, now UNESCO-recognized intangible heritage. Despite their numbers, the Oromo were historically marginalized by Ethiopian imperial rule, with their language banned in schools and government until 1991. Today, Oromo political mobilization has transformed Ethiopian politics, with an Oromo prime minister taking office in 2018.</p>

            <h2>Gadaa System</h2>
            <p>Gadaa is the traditional Oromo socio-political system organizing society into age-based grades, with political power rotating every eight years. All Oromo males pass through grades, from childhood to elderhood, with specific roles at each stage. The Gadaa assembly makes decisions democratically; leaders are elected, not hereditary; and the eight-year term limit prevents power concentration. Gadaa governed law, economics, social relations, and rituals. Ethiopian imperial expansion marginalized Gadaa, but it survived among some Oromo groups. UNESCO inscribed Gadaa as intangible cultural heritage in 2016; its democratic principles inspire contemporary Oromo political movements.</p>

            <h2>Religious Diversity</h2>
            <p>Oromo practice diverse religions. Traditional Waaqeffannaa (belief in Waaqa, the sky god) involves sacred rituals, sacrifices, and the irrecha thanksgiving ceremony. Islam spread among many Oromo communities, especially in eastern and southern regions; approximately 50% are Muslim. Orthodox Christianity, the dominant Ethiopian religion, was adopted by some Oromo, especially after imperial conquest. Protestant Christianity has grown significantly since the 20th century. This religious diversity sometimes creates tensions but also demonstrates Oromo cultural adaptability. The irrecha ceremony at Lake Hora Arsadi has become a major Oromo cultural event, transcending religious divisions.</p>

            <h2>Historical Marginalization</h2>
            <p>Ethiopian Emperor Menelik II's late 19th-century conquest of Oromo lands began over a century of marginalization. The imperial system (until 1974) and subsequent governments suppressed Oromo language, culture, and political expression. Oromo were portrayed as recent migrants (historically disputed); land was alienated; education was in Amharic only. Oromo resistance movements emerged, including the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF). The 1991 transition created the Oromia regional state, and Afaan Oromoo became official there. Yet full equality remained elusive, sparking massive protests in 2014-2018 that ultimately brought an Oromo prime minister to power.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Oromo</h2>
            <p>Modern Oromo politics are at a crossroads. The 2018 political transition raised hopes, with Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed (Oromo) winning the Nobel Peace Prize. Yet Ethiopia has since experienced civil war, ethnic violence, and political repression. Oromo face ongoing conflicts in various regions; opposition leaders have been imprisoned; and the future of ethnic federalism is debated. Cultural revival continues: Afaan Oromoo flourishes in media and education; Oromo music and literature thrive. How Oromo navigate Ethiopian politics—seeking recognition and power-sharing in a diverse country with competing nationalisms—defines their contemporary struggle.</p>
