            <h2>Who Are the Oromo?</h2>
            <p>The Oromo are Ethiopia's largest ethnic group, comprising approximately 35% of its 120 million population (42 million), making them one of Africa's largest ethnic groups. They speak Afaan Oromoo, a Cushitic language, and inhabit much of central, southern, and western Ethiopia in the Oromia region. The Oromo practice diverse religions—traditional Waaqeffanna, Islam, and Christianity. Despite their demographic majority, Oromo faced political marginalization under successive Ethiopian governments dominated by Amhara and Tigray elites. Recent decades have seen Oromo political mobilization, protests, and since 2018, Oromo Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed.</p>

            <h2>The Gadaa System</h2>
            <p>The Gadaa system is the Oromo's traditional socio-political system—a democratic age-grade structure governing social, political, economic, and religious affairs. Men progress through generational grades, with each grade lasting eight years; the gadaa grade (ages 40-48) holds political authority. Leaders are elected; power transfers peacefully every eight years. Decisions require assembly consensus. UNESCO recognized Gadaa as Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2016, acknowledging its sophisticated democratic governance predating European models. While colonialism and Ethiopian central government disrupted Gadaa, revival efforts emphasize its relevance for contemporary governance.</p>

            <h2>Coffee's Birthplace</h2>
            <p>Coffee (buna) originated in Oromo territory—the Kaffa region of southwestern Ethiopia. Oromo legend tells of a goatherd noticing his animals' energy after eating coffee berries. The Oromo have conducted coffee ceremonies for centuries, roasting, grinding, and brewing coffee in elaborate social rituals still practiced today. Coffee remains central to Oromo economy and culture. Ethiopia's coffee exports derive significantly from Oromia. The global coffee industry thus traces to Oromo land; this origin is a source of pride and a reminder that Oromo contributions extend worldwide, even when unacknowledged.</p>

            <h2>Political Marginalization and Resistance</h2>
            <p>Despite demographic majority, Oromo have historically been marginalized in Ethiopian politics dominated by Amhara and later Tigray elites. Emperor Menelik II's 19th-century conquests incorporated Oromo lands; subsequent regimes suppressed Oromo language, culture, and political expression. The Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) has fought for self-determination since 1973. Massive protests (2014-2018) against government policies destabilized the ruling coalition, contributing to Abiy Ahmed's rise—Ethiopia's first Oromo prime minister. Yet tensions continue; inter-ethnic violence and competing nationalisms make Ethiopian unity precarious.</p>

            <h2>Cultural Revival</h2>
            <p>The past decades have seen significant Oromo cultural revival. Afaan Oromoo gained official recognition; education in Oromo language expanded dramatically. Oromo music, particularly the protest songs that accompanied demonstrations, has flourished. The Irreecha festival—the Oromo thanksgiving celebration—draws millions annually to Bishoftu, becoming a statement of cultural pride. Media in Oromo language reaches global diaspora. This cultural renaissance accompanies political mobilization; Oromo identity has never been stronger, even as its relationship with Ethiopian national identity remains contested.</p>
