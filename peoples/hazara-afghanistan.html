            <h2>Who Are the Hazaras?</h2>
            <p>The Hazara are an ethnic group numbering 4-9 million (estimates vary), primarily in Afghanistan's central highlands (Hazarajat), with significant populations in Pakistan (500,000+) and Iran (300,000+), plus diaspora worldwide. They speak Hazaragi, a Persian dialect with Mongolic influences, and predominantly practice Shia Islam—distinguishing them from Afghanistan's Sunni majority. Their Asiatic features (possibly reflecting Mongol ancestry, though origins are debated) mark them as visibly different. The Hazara have faced centuries of persecution, culminating in late 19th-century genocide and ongoing violence from the Taliban and ISIS-K, making them one of the world's most endangered peoples.</p>

            <h2>Historical Persecution</h2>
            <p>Hazara persecution has deep roots. In the 1890s, Amir Abdur Rahman Khan waged campaigns that killed approximately 60% of Hazaras—enslavement, massacre, and land seizure that constituted genocide. Hazaras became Afghanistan's lowest caste, facing discrimination in education, government, and society. Their central highland homeland was impoverished and isolated. The 20th century brought continued marginalization. The Taliban's 1998 capture of Mazar-i-Sharif involved systematic massacre of Hazara civilians; the 2001 Bamiyan Buddha destruction targeted Hazara cultural heritage. This history of state-sponsored persecution shapes contemporary Hazara identity and fears.</p>

            <h2>Taliban and ISIS-K</h2>
            <p>Since the 2021 Taliban takeover, Hazara face renewed persecution. Though the Taliban promised protection, attacks continue: ISIS-K (Islamic State Khorasan) has bombed Hazara schools, mosques, and neighborhoods, killing hundreds. The Taliban has forcibly evicted Hazara from lands, arrested activists, and restricted women's education (affecting Hazara who historically supported female education). Hazaras face both Taliban governance and ISIS-K terrorism—caught between enemies. Mass exodus has followed; those remaining live in fear. The international community's limited ability to protect Hazaras under Taliban rule highlights the tragedy of Afghanistan's fall.</p>

            <h2>Diaspora and Survival</h2>
            <p>Hazara diaspora communities have grown through successive waves of refugees—Australia (particularly after the 1990s), Europe, and North America host significant populations. The journey often involves dangerous routes through Pakistan, Iran, and smuggling networks; many have died attempting to reach safety. Diaspora Hazaras maintain cultural identity through community organizations, cultural events, and advocacy for those remaining in Afghanistan. Some have achieved prominence—Khaled Hosseini (author of The Kite Runner) brought Hazara experiences to global audiences. The diaspora represents both survival and the ongoing displacement of a persecuted people.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Crisis</h2>
            <p>The current situation is dire: Hazaras in Afghanistan face ongoing ISIS-K attacks, Taliban discrimination, economic collapse, and no protection. Pakistan hosts refugees in precarious conditions, periodically threatening deportation. Those attempting to flee face dangerous journeys. International attention has waned since Afghanistan fell from headlines. Hazara advocates warn of potential genocide if conditions continue. How the international community responds—through refugee resettlement, pressure on the Taliban, protection of remaining Hazaras—may determine whether this ancient people survives in their homeland or exists only in diaspora.</p>
