            <h2>Who Are the Penan?</h2>
            <p>The Penan are a small indigenous people of the rainforests of Sarawak (Malaysia) and Brunei, numbering approximately 10,000-16,000. They speak various Penan dialects, Austronesian languages related to other Borneo languages. The Penan are unique among Bornean peoples for their traditionally nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle; while neighboring groups practiced agriculture, the Penan moved through the forest hunting wild boar, gathering sago palm starch, and harvesting forest products. Though most Penan have now settled, some small groups continued nomadic life into the 21st century. The Penan gained international attention for their resistance to logging that destroyed their forest home.</p>

            <h2>Forest Nomads</h2>
            <p>Traditional Penan life centered on the rainforest. Small bands moved through defined territories, camping in temporary shelters as they exploited seasonal resources. Wild boar was the primary game animal, hunted with blowpipes and poison darts. Sago palm provided carbohydrate staples; the Penan processed sago starch from wild palms. A vast knowledge of forest plants supported gathering of vegetables, fruits, and medicines. Forest products—rattan, camphor, bezoar stones, hornbill ivory—were traded with riverine peoples for metal, cloth, and salt. The Penan developed an ethical system based on "molong"—a concept of sustainable use, taking only what is needed and leaving resources for future generations. This ethics reflected the requirements of sustainable nomadic life in finite territory.</p>

            <h2>Anti-Logging Resistance</h2>
            <p>Beginning in the 1980s, the Penan became symbols of indigenous resistance to tropical deforestation. As logging roads penetrated their territory and forests were clear-cut, Penan communities blockaded roads, confronting timber companies and gaining international attention. Swiss activist Bruno Manser lived with the Penan and publicized their cause globally. Despite this attention, logging continued; Malaysian authorities arrested protesters; Manser disappeared in 2000, presumed dead. The resistance highlighted tensions between development and indigenous rights, between national sovereignty and international advocacy. Most Penan forest has now been logged. The blockades delayed but did not prevent destruction. The Penan experience influenced global forest protection and indigenous rights movements while demonstrating the limits of such resistance against powerful economic forces.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Penan</h2>
            <p>Modern Penan mostly live in settled communities, though conditions are often poor. Government settlement schemes provided basic services but disrupted traditional life without adequate economic alternatives. Health problems, particularly in sedentarized communities unfamiliar with agriculture, are significant. Education has expanded but integration into the cash economy remains challenging. Most forest has been logged; what remains is often degraded. A few small groups attempted to maintain nomadic life but faced increasing difficulties. Land rights remain contested; Native Customary Rights claims are often rejected or delayed. Some Penan work in logging or palm oil; others pursue education and urban employment. Cultural knowledge, including forest expertise and blowpipe crafting, is being lost as elders die. The Penan demonstrate both the tragedy of forest loss and the challenges facing formerly nomadic peoples forced into settlement.</p>
