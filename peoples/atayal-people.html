            <h2>Who Are the Atayal?</h2>
            <p>The Atayal (Tayal) are an indigenous Austronesian people of northern Taiwan, numbering approximately 90,000-95,000. They speak Atayal, a Formosan language of the Austronesian family—Taiwan is believed to be the original homeland from which Austronesian peoples spread across the Pacific and Indian Oceans. The Atayal traditionally inhabited the mountainous interior of northern and central Taiwan, from the northern tip to the central mountain range. They were renowned for their facial tattoos, headhunting tradition, and textile weaving. The Atayal are the third-largest of Taiwan's sixteen recognized indigenous peoples.</p>

            <h2>Facial Tattoos</h2>
            <p>The Atayal's most distinctive tradition was facial tattooing (ptasan), which marked gender, adulthood, and achievement. Men earned facial tattoos through headhunting—a practice that demonstrated bravery and protected the community. Women received facial tattoos upon mastering weaving, demonstrating their readiness for marriage. The V-shaped pattern on the forehead and lines extending from the lips were most characteristic. Japanese colonial authorities suppressed tattooing, and the last fully tattooed generation has passed away. However, some younger Atayal have revived tattooing as cultural affirmation, and facial tattoos appear on ceremonial occasions and in cultural representations.</p>

            <h2>Gaga Ethical Code</h2>
            <p>Atayal society was organized around the concept of gaga (also spelled qga)—a set of laws, taboos, and ritual practices governing social relationships, agriculture, and the spiritual world. Gaga regulated behavior, from marriage to hunting to conflict. Violations of gaga were believed to bring misfortune upon the individual and community. The gaga defined groups who worshipped and performed rituals together, often spanning several settlements. This ethical-spiritual system provided social cohesion and governance without centralized political authority. Christianity has largely replaced traditional religion, but gaga concepts continue to inform Atayal values and cultural identity.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Atayal</h2>
            <p>Modern Atayal participate in Taiwanese society while working to maintain cultural distinctiveness. Taiwan's Indigenous Peoples Basic Law (2005) provides legal protections and recognition. Atayal language faces decline among younger generations, though revitalization programs operate in schools. Traditional weaving has experienced revival as cultural heritage and income source. Tourism, particularly to mountain communities, provides economic opportunities. However, economic disadvantages relative to the Han Chinese majority persist. Some Atayal have achieved prominence in arts, politics, and sports. How the Atayal maintain mountain identity and cultural practices amid integration into Taiwan's developed economy shapes this Austronesian heartland people's future.</p>
