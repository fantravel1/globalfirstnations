            <h2>Who Are the Bahnar?</h2>
            <p>The Bahnar (Ba Na) are an Austro-Asiatic ethnic group of Vietnam's Central Highlands, numbering approximately 220,000-270,000. They speak Bahnar, a Mon-Khmer language. The Bahnar inhabit Gia Lai, Kon Tum, Binh Dinh, and Phu Yen provinces. They are particularly known for their spectacular rong (communal house) architecture—tall, peaked structures that serve as village centers. Unlike the matrilineal Jarai and Ede, Bahnar society is patrilineal. Historically, they practiced elaborate buffalo sacrifice ceremonies. French missionaries made early contact with the Bahnar in the 19th century, and Catholicism became widespread among them—unusual among Central Highland groups where Protestantism later dominated.</p>

            <h2>The Rong Communal House</h2>
            <p>The Bahnar rong is among Southeast Asia's most impressive indigenous architectural forms. These tall communal houses, with their dramatically peaked roofs reaching up to 20 meters, dominate traditional Bahnar villages. The rong served multiple functions: meeting place for village councils, venue for ceremonies, dormitory for unmarried young men, and repository for sacred objects. Construction required community labor and ritual. The soaring roof, visible from a distance, symbolized village identity and prosperity. While traditional construction has declined, some villages maintain or reconstruct rong for cultural heritage purposes. The architectural tradition represents Bahnar craftsmanship and community organization.</p>

            <h2>Catholic Influence</h2>
            <p>French missionaries, particularly from the Missions Étrangères de Paris, reached the Bahnar in the mid-19th century. Catholicism spread significantly among the Bahnar, more than among neighboring groups. The missionaries created the first written form of Bahnar language using Latin script. Catholic practices coexisted with traditional beliefs, creating a syncretic religious landscape. Churches became community institutions alongside the rong. This Catholic presence distinguished the Bahnar from groups like the Jarai and Ede, who later adopted Protestantism. Under communist rule, religious practice faced restrictions, but Catholicism persisted. Today, Catholic churches remain prominent in many Bahnar communities.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Bahnar</h2>
            <p>Modern Bahnar face pressures similar to other Central Highland groups. Vietnamese migration, land conversion for commercial agriculture, and development projects have transformed the highlands. The Bahnar language is taught in some schools, and cultural programs seek to preserve traditions. Catholic and traditional practices continue. Tourism has brought attention to Bahnar villages, particularly those maintaining rong houses. Agricultural practices shift from swidden to sedentary cultivation. Young Bahnar navigate between traditional identity and integration into Vietnamese society. How the Bahnar maintain their distinctive architecture, Catholic heritage, and community traditions amid modernization shapes this highland people's future.</p>
