            <h2>Who Are the Lepcha?</h2>
            <p>The Lepcha (Róng, meaning "ravine folk" in their own language) are the indigenous people of Sikkim and the Darjeeling hills of West Bengal, India, with populations also in eastern Nepal and Bhutan. Numbering approximately 50,000-60,000, they speak Lepcha (Róng-ríng), a Tibeto-Burman language with its own unique script believed to be indigenous rather than derived from other writing systems. The Lepcha traditionally inhabited the forested valleys and slopes below the high Himalayan peaks, developing an intimate relationship with the mountain environment. Their culture features extensive botanical knowledge, elaborate creation myths centered on Mount Kanchenjunga, and distinctive religious practices blending indigenous beliefs with Buddhism.</p>

            <h2>Mountain Culture</h2>
            <p>Traditional Lepcha culture was shaped by the subtropical to temperate mountain forests of their homeland. They practiced shifting cultivation, hunting, and gathering, developing extensive knowledge of plants used for food, medicine, and construction. The bow and arrow was central to hunting; bamboo and cane were essential materials. Traditional religion featured mun (priests) and bongthing (shamans) who communicated with spirits and performed rituals for health, agriculture, and community welfare. Mount Kanchenjunga, the world's third highest peak, was sacred—the home of gods and repository of hidden treasures. Lepcha cosmology featured elaborate creation myths and a rich oral literature. Buddhism arrived through Tibetan influence, mixing with indigenous beliefs rather than replacing them.</p>

            <h2>Historical Marginalization</h2>
            <p>The Lepcha's position as original inhabitants was transformed by later migrations. The Bhutia (Tibetan) arrival established the Sikkimese kingdom, with Lepcha often in subordinate positions despite their indigenous status. Nepali migration, especially in the 19th-20th centuries, made the Lepcha a small minority in their homeland. British colonial policies favored plantation development and labor immigration. By the time Sikkim merged with India (1975), Lepcha were far outnumbered. This demographic marginalization threatened cultural survival. The Lepcha script, traditional knowledge, and religious practices declined as education favored Nepali and English, and modernity transformed mountain economies.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Lepcha</h2>
            <p>Modern Lepcha communities work actively for cultural revitalization. The Lepcha script, having faced near extinction, is now taught in some schools and used in publications. Cultural organizations promote traditional practices, language preservation, and documentation of oral literature. The Lepcha have protested hydropower projects threatening sacred landscapes around Kanchenjunga. The Dzongu reserve in North Sikkim provides some cultural protection—non-Lepcha cannot purchase land there. Buddhist monasteries continue traditional religious practices, while indigenous bongthing traditions are being documented and revived. The Lepcha demonstrate how small indigenous communities can organize for cultural survival even when demographically marginalized in their traditional territories.</p>
