            <h2>Who Are the Cowlitz?</h2>
            <p>The Cowlitz Indian Tribe has approximately 4,300 enrolled members, headquartered in Longview, Washington. Their traditional territory encompassed the Cowlitz River watershed from Mount Rainier and Mount St. Helens to the Columbia River. The tribe includes descendants of Upper Cowlitz (Sahaptin speakers) and Lower Cowlitz (Coast Salish speakers)—two linguistically distinct groups sharing the river valley. Both languages are now extinct or nearly so. The Cowlitz sought federal recognition for over a century, finally achieving it in 2000—one of the longest recognition struggles in American history.</p>

            <h2>Century-Long Struggle</h2>
            <p>The Cowlitz fought for federal recognition for over a century. Though they signed no treaty (the 1855 treaty council failed), they maintained continuous identity as a tribe. The Cowlitz filed a claim with the Indian Claims Commission in 1931—one of the first tribes to do so. Decades of litigation and administrative process followed. The Bureau of Indian Affairs denied recognition in 1997; reversal came through BIA reconsideration and legal action. The 2000 recognition ended the longest recognition struggle of any tribe. This persistence—maintaining identity without land, recognition, or federal resources—demonstrates extraordinary community cohesion.</p>

            <h2>Mount St. Helens</h2>
            <p>Mount St. Helens (Lawetlat'la, "Smoker") stands within traditional Cowlitz territory. The volcano held spiritual significance; its 1980 eruption destroyed traditional berry-picking areas and fundamentally altered the landscape. The Cowlitz maintain connection to the mountain despite volcanic devastation. Spirit Lake, at the mountain's base, was a sacred site now buried under debris. The eruption coincided with the Cowlitz recognition struggle, adding symbolic weight to their perseverance. Environmental programs now address lands affected by volcanic activity and subsequent logging within their ancestral territory.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Cowlitz</h2>
            <p>Modern Cowlitz have rapidly built capacity since 2000 recognition. The ilani Casino Resort, opened in 2017, generates substantial revenue. Land has been taken into trust for various purposes. The tribe has established health, education, and cultural programs. Language preservation faces challenges with few or no fluent speakers remaining—documentation and teaching work from historical materials. Environmental programs address Cowlitz River watershed health. How the Cowlitz build institutions and preserve culture after a century without recognition shapes this river-and-mountain people's determined future.</p>
