            <h2>Who Are the Wolof People?</h2>
            <p>The Wolof are the dominant ethnic group of Senegal, comprising approximately 43% of its 17 million population (7 million), with additional populations in Gambia and Mauritania. Wolof is Senegal's lingua franca—spoken by nearly all Senegalese regardless of ethnicity. The Wolof established powerful kingdoms including the Jolof Empire (14th-16th centuries) that dominated the region. Known for their influence on Senegalese culture, arts, and politics, the Wolof have shaped what it means to be Senegalese. Their concept of teranga (hospitality) has become a national value.</p>

            <h2>Teranga: Radical Hospitality</h2>
            <p>Teranga—Wolof hospitality—has become Senegal's defining cultural value. Guests are fed first and best; strangers receive welcome and assistance; hospitality is a moral imperative. Senegalese call their country "the land of teranga." This ethic shapes social relationships, business practices, and national identity. Restaurants serve abundant portions; households share meals with neighbors; travelers can expect help. Teranga connects to Islamic values and traditional African hospitality but has become particularly associated with Senegalese/Wolof identity, distinguishing Senegal in a troubled region for its stability and welcoming culture.</p>

            <h2>The Griots</h2>
            <p>Griots (gewel in Wolof) are hereditary oral historians, musicians, and praise-singers. They preserve genealogies, history, and traditional knowledge through memorized narratives and songs. At ceremonies—weddings, naming ceremonies, political events—griots perform, praising hosts and guests, reciting lineages, and affirming social relationships. The sabar drum tradition and mbalax music derive from griot heritage. Famous griot families maintain status; Youssou N'Dour, Senegal's global music star, comes from a griot family. The griot tradition represents living historical knowledge and demonstrates the sophisticated oral cultures that recorded African history before writing.</p>

            <h2>Mouride Brotherhood</h2>
            <p>The Mouride Brotherhood (Mouridiyya) is a Sufi Islamic order founded by Amadou Bamba in 1883, now claiming millions of followers, predominantly Wolof. Mourides emphasize work as worship; their agricultural communities transformed Senegal's peanut economy. The annual Magal pilgrimage to Touba, the holy city Bamba founded, draws 3-4 million pilgrims. Mouride influence extends to commerce—Mouride trading networks span global cities. The brotherhood's economic and political power makes it central to Senegalese life. This distinctive form of Islam, blending Sufi mysticism with work ethic and strong organization, represents Wolof religious innovation.</p>

            <h2>Senegalese Identity</h2>
            <p>Wolof culture has effectively become Senegalese national culture. The Wolof language, though only native to 43%, is spoken by nearly all Senegalese; "Wolofization" gradually assimilates other groups. Dakar, the capital, is predominantly Wolof. Fashion, music, food, and social norms reflect Wolof patterns. This dominance generates tensions with other groups like the Serer and Diola who resist assimilation. Yet Senegal has maintained relative ethnic peace through inclusive national ideology. How Wolof hegemony balances with pluralism shapes Senegalese nation-building.</p>
