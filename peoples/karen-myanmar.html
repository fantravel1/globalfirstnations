            <h2>Who Are the Karen?</h2>
            <p>The Karen (Kayin, Kariang) are an ethnic group of approximately 7 million people inhabiting the mountainous borderlands between Myanmar (Burma) and Thailand. They comprise numerous subgroups including Sgaw, Pwo, Bwe, and Kayah (Karenni), speaking related but distinct languages. The Karen have fought one of the world's longest civil wars against the Myanmar government since 1949, seeking autonomy or independence. Hundreds of thousands have fled as refugees to Thailand, and many have resettled in countries including the United States, where Karen diaspora communities now number over 200,000.</p>

            <h2>The World's Longest War</h2>
            <p>Since 1949, Karen armed groups have fought the Myanmar government for self-determination. The conflict has killed tens of thousands, displaced millions, and created one of Asia's largest refugee populations. The Karen National Union (KNU) controls territory along the Thai border, maintaining schools, courts, and administration. Despite periodic ceasefires, fighting continues, intensifying after Myanmar's 2021 military coup. For Karen communities, the conflict is not ancient ethnic hatred but a struggle against centralized Burman dominance and for the right to live on ancestral lands.</p>

            <h2>Refugee Experience</h2>
            <p>Approximately 100,000 Karen live in refugee camps along the Thai-Myanmar border, some for over 30 years. These camps developed into semi-permanent towns with schools, churches, and governance structures. Since 2005, resettlement programs have moved tens of thousands of Karen to the US, Australia, Canada, and elsewhere. Resettlement brings challenges: language barriers, cultural adjustment, economic uncertainty, and separation from extended family. Karen communities in cities like St. Paul, Minnesota have established cultural organizations maintaining traditions in diaspora.</p>

            <h2>Traditional Beliefs and Christianity</h2>
            <p>Traditionally, the Karen practiced animism, believing in spirits of forests, rivers, and ancestors. Beginning in the 19th century, Baptist missionaries found remarkable success among the Karen, and today approximately 30% are Christian (mostly Baptist), while others are Buddhist or maintain traditional beliefs. Christianity became intertwined with Karen nationalism—the KNU flag features a rising sun that some link to Biblical symbolism. Churches serve as community centers in both refugee camps and diaspora communities, maintaining Karen language and culture through religious practice.</p>

            <h2>Weaving and Material Culture</h2>
            <p>Karen women are renowned weavers, creating distinctive textiles on backstrap looms. Traditional dress varies by subgroup and occasion, with unmarried women wearing white dresses and married women wearing more colorful patterns. Weaving knowledge passes through generations, with patterns carrying cultural meanings. In refugee camps and resettlement communities, weaving provides both income and cultural continuity. Karen textile cooperatives sell internationally, providing economic opportunity while preserving traditional skills that connect weavers to ancestors.</p>
