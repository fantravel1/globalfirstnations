            <h2>Who Are the Karen?</h2>
            <p>The Karen (Kayin, Kariang) are an ethnic group of approximately 7-8 million, primarily in Myanmar (Burma)—where they form the third-largest ethnic group—and Thailand (about 1 million). They speak Karen languages, part of the Sino-Tibetan family, with Sgaw and Pwo being major varieties. The Karen have waged the world's longest-running insurgency against Myanmar's central government since 1949, seeking autonomy or independence. Decades of conflict have created massive displacement—hundreds of thousands in refugee camps (especially in Thailand) and internally displaced. The Karen experience epitomizes Myanmar's ethnic conflicts that have intensified since the 2021 military coup.</p>

            <h2>Ethnic Identity</h2>
            <p>Karen identity encompasses several related groups with distinct languages and traditions: Sgaw, Pwo, Kayah (Karenni), Pa-O, and others. Religiously diverse, Karen include Christians (significant conversion during British colonial era, particularly Baptists), Buddhists, and practitioners of traditional religion. The Karen origin myth tells of crossing a river, losing their written script, and awaiting its return—missionary arrival fulfilled this prophecy for many, spurring conversion. This religious diversity sometimes complicates Karen unity; Christian-dominated resistance groups don't always represent all Karen. Despite differences, a pan-Karen identity has developed through shared struggle against Burman domination.</p>

            <h2>Conflict History</h2>
            <p>Karen resistance began immediately after Burma's independence (1948). The Karen National Union (KNU) and its armed wing, Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA), have fought since 1949—the world's longest-running civil war. The conflict involves complex factors: ethnic marginalization, disputes over federalism versus centralism, and Myanmar military (Tatmadaw) brutality. Campaigns against Karen villages include burning, forced labor, rape, and murder—documented human rights violations. Cease-fires have periodically reduced fighting but never resolved underlying grievances. The 2021 coup reignited conflict; Karen forces joined broader resistance against the junta, facing renewed military offensives.</p>

            <h2>Refugees and Displacement</h2>
            <p>Decades of conflict have displaced millions. Thailand hosts approximately 90,000 Karen in official refugee camps (Mae La is largest); many more live outside camps. Internal displacement within Myanmar is massive—villages burned, populations fleeing military operations. Third-country resettlement has created Karen diaspora in USA, Australia, Canada, and elsewhere (approximately 100,000 Karen in the US). Life in camps—some refugees born there have never left in 30+ years—creates generational trauma and uncertainty. How refugees maintain Karen identity while adapting to new countries or hoping for return defines diaspora experience.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Karen</h2>
            <p>Modern Karen face ongoing crisis. The 2021 coup ended peace process hopes; military offensives displaced hundreds of thousands in 2021-2024. Karen armed groups joined broader resistance (People's Defense Forces), but military superiority creates devastation. In Thailand, Karen refugees face uncertain legal status and camp conditions; those outside camps work illegally with limited rights. Diaspora communities maintain culture—traditional dress, music, Karen New Year celebrations—while integrating into new societies. The Karen future depends on Myanmar's political trajectory: genuine federalism would address grievances; continued military rule means continued conflict and displacement.</p>
