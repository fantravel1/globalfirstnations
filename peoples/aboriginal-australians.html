            <h2>Who Are Aboriginal Australians?</h2>
            <p>Aboriginal Australians comprise hundreds of distinct nations with over 250 languages across mainland Australia—representing humanity's oldest continuous cultures with 65,000+ years of occupation. Today approximately 800,000 identify as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander (the latter being Melanesian peoples of the islands between Australia and Papua New Guinea). Prior to British colonization in 1788, population estimates range from 300,000 to 1 million. Aboriginal cultures developed sophisticated land management, complex kinship systems, rich artistic traditions, and profound spiritual connections to Country. Colonial violence and policies caused immense harm; contemporary Aboriginal Australians work toward recognition, rights, and cultural revival.</p>

            <h2>The Dreaming</h2>
            <p>The Dreaming (Tjukurpa, Jukurrpa, and many other terms across languages) encompasses Aboriginal spirituality, cosmology, and law. Ancestral beings created the land, established laws, and remain present in Country—in specific landforms, waterholes, and sacred sites. The Dreaming isn't "past time" but an ongoing reality; ritual, song, and art maintain connection. Each Aboriginal person belongs to Country—specific land with which they share spiritual responsibility. Songlines traverse the continent, encoding navigation, law, and history in oral tradition. This profound connection to land makes dispossession particularly devastating—separation from Country means spiritual as well as physical loss.</p>

            <h2>Colonial Violence</h2>
            <p>British colonization declared Australia terra nullius—land belonging to no one—denying Aboriginal sovereignty. What followed was catastrophic: frontier violence killed tens of thousands; introduced diseases devastated populations; people were forced onto missions and reserves. The "Stolen Generations" (roughly 1910-1970) saw Aboriginal children forcibly removed from families to be assimilated—a policy now recognized as genocide. Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's 2008 apology acknowledged this harm. The 1992 Mabo decision overturned terra nullius, recognizing native title, though land rights remain contested. This history of violence and dispossession shapes contemporary Aboriginal experience.</p>

            <h2>Art and Cultural Expression</h2>
            <p>Aboriginal art represents the world's longest continuous artistic tradition. Rock art sites include paintings dated to 17,000+ years. Contemporary Aboriginal art—particularly Western Desert dot painting—has achieved international recognition, with artists like Emily Kame Kngwarreye and Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri exhibited globally. Art isn't mere decoration; it encodes Dreaming stories, Country, and cultural knowledge—meaning non-initiated viewers may only see surface aesthetics while deeper meanings remain protected. Music including the didjeridu (yidaki), clapsticks, and oral traditions continues. Art provides both cultural expression and economic opportunity, though appropriation and exploitation remain concerns.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Issues</h2>
            <p>Aboriginal Australians face significant disparities in health, education, incarceration (vastly over-represented in prisons), and life expectancy. The "Closing the Gap" policy attempts to address these inequalities with mixed success. Land rights and native title enable some communities to benefit from mining royalties; others remain in poverty. The Uluru Statement from the Heart (2017) called for constitutional recognition through a Voice to Parliament—rejected in the 2023 referendum, devastating many Aboriginal advocates. How Australia reckons with its colonial past and addresses Aboriginal disadvantage while recognizing Indigenous rights remains the nation's unfinished business.</p>
