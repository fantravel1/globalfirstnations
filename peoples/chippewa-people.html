            <h2>Who Are the Chippewa?</h2>
            <p>The Chippewa (Ojibwe, Ojibwa) are an Anishinaabe people constituting one of the largest Native American nations in North America. In the United States, the term "Chippewa" is commonly used; in Canada, "Ojibwe" or "Ojibway" is more common—both derive from a term meaning "puckered," possibly referring to the puckered seams of their moccasins. US Chippewa number approximately 150,000-170,000, residing primarily in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Dakota, and Montana. They speak Ojibwemowin (Chippewa/Ojibwe language), the third most spoken Native American language in the US after Navajo and Sioux. The Chippewa are renowned for wild rice harvesting, birch bark canoe construction, and the Midewiwin spiritual tradition.</p>

            <h2>Wild Rice Culture</h2>
            <p>Wild rice (manoomin, "good berry" or "good seed") is central to Chippewa culture. This aquatic grass grows in lakes and rivers throughout the Great Lakes region; Anishinaabe oral history describes the people's migration to find "food that grows on water." Traditional harvesting involves canoes, with one person poling while another knocks ripe rice into the canoe using wooden sticks. The rice is then processed through multiple stages: parching, hulling, and winnowing. Wild rice harvesting season (late August-September) remains an important cultural event. Efforts to protect wild rice lakes from mining and pollution have become major environmental campaigns. The genetic integrity of naturally occurring wild rice is also a concern as commercial cultivation spreads. Wild rice is both subsistence food and sacred gift.</p>

            <h2>Treaties and Sovereignty</h2>
            <p>The Chippewa signed numerous treaties with the US government between 1820 and 1867, ceding vast territories while reserving rights to hunt, fish, and gather in ceded territories—including wild rice harvesting, hunting, and fishing rights. These treaty rights were affirmed in the landmark 1983 Voigt Decision and subsequent cases, allowing Chippewa to exercise off-reservation spearfishing rights in Wisconsin despite violent non-Native opposition during the "Walleye Wars" of the late 1980s. Treaty rights remain central to Chippewa political identity. Minnesota Chippewa bands organized as the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe; Wisconsin bands maintain separate governments. Major reservations include Red Lake (unique as the only closed reservation in Minnesota), White Earth, Leech Lake, Fond du Lac, Lac Courte Oreilles, and Red Cliff.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Chippewa</h2>
            <p>Modern Chippewa communities face challenges including poverty, health disparities, and the effects of historical trauma, while also experiencing cultural revitalization. Gaming operations (casinos) have brought economic development to many reservations, with variable success. The Ojibwe language, though endangered, is being revitalized through immersion schools and community programs; Minnesota's Bug-O-Nay-Ge-Shig School and Wisconsin's Waadookodaading are immersion successes. The Midewiwin spiritual tradition continues, as do powwows and other cultural events. Political issues include opposing mining projects that threaten wild rice waters and expanding food sovereignty. Notable contemporary Chippewa include author Louise Erdrich (Turtle Mountain) and activist Winona LaDuke (White Earth). The Chippewa demonstrate how treaty rights, cultural traditions, and community organization enable survival and revitalization.</p>
