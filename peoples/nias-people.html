            <h2>Who Are the Nias?</h2>
            <p>The Nias (Ono Niha, "people of Nias") are the indigenous inhabitants of Nias Island and surrounding smaller islands off the western coast of Sumatra, Indonesia. Numbering approximately 800,000-900,000, they speak Nias (Li Niha), an Austronesian language with significant isolation-driven divergence from mainland languages. The Nias are renowned for their megalithic culture—massive stone monuments, elaborate stone-paved village plazas, and traditional houses with distinctive architecture. Their stone-jumping ritual (fahombo), where young men leap over tall stone pillars, has become an internationally recognized symbol of Nias warrior culture.</p>

            <h2>Megalithic Culture</h2>
            <p>Nias developed one of Southeast Asia's most impressive megalithic cultures. Traditional villages—particularly in South Nias—feature massive stone pavements, stone seats, stone tables, and vertical stone monuments (some weighing tons). Moving these stones required community mobilization; erecting monuments marked prestige and status. Traditional houses (omo hada) are architectural marvels—massive wooden structures on ironwood posts, resistant to earthquakes through flexible construction. House-building and stone-moving were occasions for competitive feasting (owasa) where chiefs displayed wealth and generosity. This megalithic tradition connected Nias to older Austronesian patterns found from Madagascar to Easter Island while developing distinctive local expression.</p>

            <h2>Fahombo Stone Jumping</h2>
            <p>Fahombo, the Nias stone-jumping ceremony, involves young men leaping over stone pillars up to 2 meters high—a feat of athleticism and courage. Historically, successful jumping marked a young man's readiness for warfare and marriage; the practice developed when inter-village warfare was common and walls needed to be vaulted in attacks. Warriors (bela) who could jump stone defenses were valued. Though warfare has ended, stone jumping continues as cultural tradition, now performed primarily for tourists and cultural events. The image of young men in traditional dress clearing the stone has become iconic of Nias and appears in Indonesian tourism promotion.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Nias</h2>
            <p>Modern Nias has been transformed by Christianity (predominantly Protestant, converting in large numbers during the 20th century), education, and integration into Indonesian national life. The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and 2005 Nias earthquake devastated the island, killing thousands and destroying villages. International aid and reconstruction followed, including efforts to preserve traditional architecture while rebuilding. Tourism had been growing around surfing (Lagundri Bay), traditional culture, and village visits before the disasters; recovery has continued. Traditional villages like Bawömataluo (South Nias) attract visitors to see architecture and stone jumping, though authenticity debates arise. Many Nias have migrated to mainland Sumatra for economic opportunities. The Nias navigate preserving spectacular heritage while rebuilding from disasters and adapting to modernity.</p>
