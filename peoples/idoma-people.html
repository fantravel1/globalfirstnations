            <h2>Who Are the Idoma?</h2>
            <p>The Idoma are an ethnic group of central Nigeria, primarily inhabiting Benue State in the lower Benue River valley. Numbering approximately 4-5 million, they are one of the major ethnic groups in the Middle Belt region. The Idoma speak Idoma, an Idomoid language of the Niger-Congo family, related to neighboring Igede and Tiv languages. Their traditional homeland lies south of the Benue River, in relatively hilly terrain suited to agriculture. The Idoma are known for their elaborate masquerade traditions, including the Alekwu ancestor cult and various ekpo masquerades that play important social and religious roles. Their position in the Middle Belt has shaped their politics in Nigeria's complex ethnic landscape.</p>

            <h2>Masquerade Traditions</h2>
            <p>Idoma masquerade traditions are among Nigeria's most elaborate. The Alekwu ancestor cult involves masquerades representing deceased elders who return to counsel and discipline the living. These figures, wearing distinctive costumes and masks, appear at funerals, festivals, and times of community crisis. Various other masquerade societies serve social control, entertainment, and religious functions. The Ogrinya and other masquerades enforce moral codes and punish transgressors. Mask carving and costume production are specialized crafts. While Christianity has reduced some masquerade participation, traditions continue in many communities, adapted to contemporary circumstances. The masquerades represent Idoma connections with ancestors and the spiritual world.</p>

            <h2>Decentralized Organization</h2>
            <p>Traditional Idoma society was organized around autonomous communities rather than centralized kingdoms. Each district had its own leadership structure based on age grades, title societies, and councils of elders. The absence of overall centralization meant no single Idoma state existed; rather, shared language, culture, and intermarriage connected independent communities. British colonial administration imposed artificial chieftaincy structures. Post-colonial Idoma political organization has developed through the Idoma National Forum and other organizations advocating for group interests. This decentralized tradition means multiple voices claim to represent Idoma, with debates about leadership and representation continuing.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Idoma</h2>
            <p>Modern Idoma participate in Nigerian national life while advocating for Middle Belt regional interests. Their position in Benue State, shared with Tiv who are more numerous, creates political competition for resources and positions. Idoma leaders have served in national government including as senate president. Agricultural economies continue; yams, cassava, and palm produce remain important. Education has expanded, producing Idoma professionals across Nigerian society. Urban migration creates diaspora communities in major cities. Farmer-herder conflicts have affected some Idoma areas as clashes with Fulani pastoralists have increased regionally. Cultural festivals celebrate Idoma heritage; efforts to preserve masquerade traditions and language continue amid modernizing pressures. The Idoma navigate as a significant Middle Belt group in Nigeria's complex ethnic politics.</p>
