            <h2>Who Are the Melanau?</h2>
            <p>The Melanau are an indigenous coastal people of central Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo, inhabiting the river mouths and coastal swamps between Bintulu and Mukah. Numbering approximately 130,000-150,000, they are among Sarawak's larger indigenous groups. They speak various Melanau dialects, Austronesian languages sometimes considered a single language with significant variation. The Melanau are distinguished by their historical reliance on sago palm cultivation in the coastal swamps—an adaptation unique among Bornean peoples—and by their religious diversity: some Melanau are Muslim, some Christian, and a small number retain traditional animist beliefs.</p>

            <h2>Sago Culture</h2>
            <p>Unlike most Bornean peoples who depended on rice, the Melanau traditionally relied on sago palm as their staple food—an adaptation to the coastal swamp environment where rice cultivation was difficult. Sago palms were cultivated in the swampy areas; their pith was processed into flour (tebaloi, linut) that served as the dietary foundation. Sago processing was labor-intensive but the palms thrived in otherwise unusable wetlands. This unique subsistence pattern shaped Melanau settlement (coastal and riverine), economy (sago and fishing), and culture. Sago remains significant in Melanau cuisine, with sago-based foods featured in cultural events, though rice has become the daily staple for most families.</p>

            <h2>Religious Diversity</h2>
            <p>The Melanau exhibit remarkable religious diversity. Historically animist (practicing likou religion with beliefs in spirits and taboos), they were exposed to Islam through coastal trade connections beginning centuries ago. A significant portion converted to Islam, becoming Melanau Muslim; today approximately 60-70% of Melanau are Muslim. Christian missionaries arrived in the 19th century; perhaps 20-25% are now Christian (primarily Catholic). A small percentage retain traditional likou beliefs or blend traditions. This religious heterogeneity is unusual among Bornean indigenous peoples and reflects the Melanau's coastal position facilitating outside contacts. Inter-religious family ties maintain Melanau unity despite religious differences—a model of indigenous pluralism.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Melanau</h2>
            <p>Modern Melanau communities have diversified economically while maintaining cultural connections. The coastal region has developed with petroleum industry (Bintulu area), fisheries, and agriculture. Many Melanau have achieved education and professional careers; several prominent Sarawak politicians have been Melanau, including former chief ministers. The Melanau language faces pressure from Malay and English; younger generations often speak Malay primarily. Cultural festivals including Kaul (sea spirit festival, pre-Islamic) continue among traditional-practice Melanau and have been adapted as cultural heritage events. Sago-based cuisine and traditional houses (tall wooden structures elevated above floods) represent heritage. The Melanau demonstrate how indigenous peoples can maintain identity while adapting to religious change, economic transformation, and political integration.</p>
