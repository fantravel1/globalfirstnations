            <h2>Who Are the Bretons?</h2>
            <p>The Bretons (Brezhoneg: Bretoned) are a Celtic people of Brittany (Breizh) in northwestern France, numbering approximately 4-5 million (Brittany's total population, though ethnic identification varies widely). Perhaps 200,000-300,000 speak Breton, a Celtic language related to Welsh and Cornish rather than French. Bretons descend from Romano-British refugees who fled Anglo-Saxon invasion (5th-6th centuries), bringing Celtic language and culture to the Armorican peninsula. Despite French centralization since the 15th century, Bretons maintain distinctive identity—Celtic heritage, separate language, strong regional consciousness—making Brittany one of France's most culturally distinct regions.</p>

            <h2>Celtic Origins</h2>
            <p>Brittany's Celtic character stems from British migration (5th-6th centuries CE). Romano-British fleeing Anglo-Saxon invasion joined Armorica's existing population, establishing Breton language and culture. Small kingdoms emerged; Breton cavalry resisted Frankish expansion. The Duchy of Brittany maintained independence through medieval period, allied with England against France at times. Saints from Britain and Ireland Christianized the region; the Tro Breizh pilgrimage connects seven founding saints' cathedrals. This insular Celtic heritage—distinct from mainland French culture—creates cultural kinship with Wales, Cornwall, Ireland, and Scotland expressed through pan-Celtic festivals and solidarity.</p>

            <h2>French Incorporation</h2>
            <p>Union with France (1532) began gradual erosion of Breton autonomy. The French Revolution abolished regional privileges; the centralizing French state promoted linguistic uniformity. The 19th-20th centuries brought systematic suppression: Breton was banned in schools, children punished for speaking it, and Brittany was labeled backward. The shame campaigns ("Spit on the ground for speaking Breton") devastated transmission. World War I killed a generation; economic migration drained population. By 1950s, Breton survived mainly among elderly rural speakers. This linguistic catastrophe—from universal to endangered in a century—exemplifies French centralization's cultural cost.</p>

            <h2>Revival Efforts</h2>
            <p>The post-1968 period brought Breton revival. Diwan schools (immersion education, founded 1977) teach through Breton; bilingual public and Catholic schools expanded options. Perhaps 15,000 children now receive Breton-medium education. Cultural revival includes fest-noz (night festivals), Celtic music (Alan Stivell, Tri Yann), and renewed pride. Yet Breton lacks official status; France hasn't ratified the European Charter for Regional Languages. Most speakers are elderly; intergenerational transmission remains weak. The revival has stabilized decline but not reversed it. Brittany's political autonomy movement remains marginal, but cultural distinctiveness persists despite French republicanism's uniformity ideal.</p>

            <h2>Breton Culture Today</h2>
            <p>Contemporary Breton culture thrives despite language's fragility. The fest-noz (traditional dance gatherings) attract thousands. Breton music—mixing Celtic traditions with rock, folk, and electronic—enjoys international success. The black-and-white Gwenn-ha-du flag is ubiquitous. Cuisine features crêpes, galettes, cider, and seafood. Pardons (religious festivals) continue ancient traditions. The coastal landscape—rugged cliffs, fishing villages, megaliths (Carnac's standing stones predate Bretons)—attracts tourism. Breton identity is strong even among those who don't speak the language. How Brittany maintains distinctiveness within centralized France while attempting linguistic revival shapes this Celtic people's future in their Atlantic homeland.</p>
