            <h2>Who Are the Edo?</h2>
            <p>The Edo (also Bini) are an ethnic group of southern Nigeria, primarily inhabiting Edo State, centered on Benin City—not to be confused with the separate Republic of Benin. Numbering approximately 4-5 million, the Edo are heirs to the historic Benin Kingdom, one of Africa's most powerful pre-colonial states, renowned for its sophisticated bronze sculpture, elaborate court rituals, and centuries-long resistance to European colonization until the British invasion of 1897. The Edo speak Edo (Bini), an Edoid language of the Niger-Congo family. Their cultural legacy, particularly the Benin Bronzes now held in Western museums, remains central to global debates about colonial looting and repatriation.</p>

            <h2>Benin Kingdom</h2>
            <p>The Benin Kingdom (Edo Empire) flourished from approximately the 13th century until the British invasion of 1897. Ruled by divine kings (Obas) from the Eweka dynasty, Benin developed a centralized state with elaborate court hierarchy, sophisticated bureaucracy, and extensive trade networks reaching to Europe by the 15th century. The kingdom was famous for bronze and brass casting using the lost-wax technique; guild craftsmen produced commemorative heads, plaques depicting court life, and other works of extraordinary artistic sophistication. Portuguese contacts from 1485 initiated trade in pepper, cloth, and eventually enslaved people. Benin maintained independence and diplomatic relations with European powers for four centuries before British conquest.</p>

            <h2>Bronzes and Repatriation</h2>
            <p>The British Punitive Expedition of 1897 conquered Benin City, exiling the Oba and looting thousands of artworks—the Benin Bronzes. These treasures were distributed to museums and private collections worldwide, with major holdings in the British Museum, Berlin's Ethnological Museum, and numerous other institutions. Repatriation demands have grown since Nigerian independence; in the 2020s, Germany, France, and other countries have begun returning bronzes to Nigeria. The British Museum continues to resist full repatriation. A new Edo Museum of West African Art, designed by David Adjaye, will house returned objects. The Benin Bronzes case has become the most prominent example in global debates about colonial looting and cultural heritage return.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Edo</h2>
            <p>Modern Edo maintain cultural identity centered on the Oba's continuing ceremonial role. The monarchy was restored under colonial rule; the current Oba Ewuare II, crowned in 2016, serves as cultural leader while the Nigerian government holds political authority. Benin City has grown into a major urban center. Traditional crafts including bronze casting continue, though contemporary production differs from historical techniques. The Igue and other annual festivals celebrate Edo heritage. Economically, the Edo face challenges common to Nigerian states; diaspora migration, including to Europe (often through dangerous routes), affects many families. Political identity connects to Edo State formation (1991) and ongoing negotiations within Nigerian federalism. The Edo represent one of Africa's great kingdoms, maintaining cultural continuity while navigating contemporary challenges.</p>
