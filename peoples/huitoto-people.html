            <h2>Who Are the Huitoto?</h2>
            <p>The Huitoto (Uitoto, Witoto) are an indigenous people of the Colombia-Peru border region, traditionally inhabiting the interfluvial forests between the Caquetá (Japurá) and Putumayo rivers. Today numbering approximately 8,000-10,000, they were far more numerous before the catastrophic rubber boom era. They speak several related languages of the Witotoan family. The Huitoto are known for their sophisticated use of coca (mambe) and tobacco (ambil) in ritual and daily life, their maloca (communal longhouse) social organization, elaborate ceremonial dances, and the rubber-era genocide that reduced their population by perhaps 90%. Their experience became internationally known through Roger Casement's 1912 report on atrocities committed by the Peruvian Amazon Company.</p>

            <h2>Coca and Tobacco Complex</h2>
            <p>Central to Huitoto culture is the ceremonial and daily use of coca and tobacco. Men prepare mambe by toasting coca leaves and mixing them with ash from yarumo leaves, producing a green powder consumed by placing it in the cheek. Ambil is a tobacco paste prepared by cooking tobacco leaves into a thick syrup. These substances are consumed during nightly gatherings in the maloca, where men discuss community affairs, tell myths, and transmit knowledge. The "word of coca and tobacco" refers to the sacred teachings communicated through these rituals. Unlike Andean coca chewing or the cocaine trade, this Amazonian coca complex involves different varieties, preparation methods, and cultural meanings. Coca and tobacco enable communication with spirits and are essential to proper social and ritual life.</p>

            <h2>The Rubber Genocide</h2>
            <p>The rubber boom (1879-1912) brought apocalyptic destruction to the Huitoto. The Peruvian Amazon Company (Casa Arana) enslaved Huitoto, Bora, Andoke, and other peoples, forcing them to collect wild rubber under torture, mutilation, and murder. Entire villages were destroyed; people were hunted like animals. Conservative estimates suggest 30,000-40,000 deaths among Huitoto and neighboring peoples. Roger Casement's investigation for the British government documented these atrocities, which became an international scandal. The rubber bust (1912) ended the worst exploitation but left devastated populations. The Colombian-Peruvian War (1932-1933) further displaced surviving Huitoto. This genocide fundamentally disrupted Huitoto society—knowledge, ceremonies, and social structures were lost with the elders who died. Contemporary Huitoto culture represents reconstruction from this catastrophe.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Huitoto</h2>
            <p>Modern Huitoto have worked to rebuild culture from near-destruction. Malocas have been reconstructed; ceremonies revived. The coca-tobacco complex continues, providing framework for cultural transmission. Traditional ecological knowledge of the interfluvial forests—plants, animals, agriculture—remains substantial. Huitoto artists produce bark cloth paintings depicting mythology and daily life that have gained international recognition. Colombia's 1991 constitution provided rights to indigenous territories and cultural practices. The Predio Putumayo indigenous reserve covers substantial traditional territory. Challenges include ongoing armed conflict in the region, drug trafficking, and economic marginalization. Some Huitoto have migrated to cities, particularly Leticia. The Huitoto language remains vital among speakers but is declining overall. The Huitoto story represents both the worst impacts of colonialism and resource extraction on indigenous peoples and the possibilities of cultural recovery from near-annihilation.</p>
