            <h2>Who Are the Bedouin?</h2>
            <p>The Bedouin (Arabic: badawī, "desert dweller") are traditionally nomadic Arab peoples of the deserts of the Middle East and North Africa—the Arabian Peninsula, Syrian Desert, Sinai, Negev, and Saharan regions. Total population of those identifying as Bedouin is approximately 4-5 million, though many more are of Bedouin descent but now settled. They speak various Arabic dialects. The Bedouin developed sophisticated adaptations to desert life, centered on camel and goat herding, raiding, and long-distance trade. Bedouin tribal society, with its codes of honor, hospitality, and blood feud, profoundly influenced Arab culture broadly. The discovery of oil and creation of modern states have transformed Bedouin life, with most now settled, though some maintain semi-nomadic patterns.</p>

            <h2>Desert Adaptation</h2>
            <p>Bedouin life was shaped by the harsh realities of desert environments—extreme temperatures, scarce water, limited vegetation. The camel made desert life possible: it provided transportation across waterless expanses, milk (a dietary staple), meat, hair for weaving, and wealth and prestige. Bedouin moved seasonally between water sources and grazing areas, their routes determined by geography and tribal territories. The black goat-hair tent (bayt al-sha'r, "house of hair") provided shelter, its design allowing air circulation in heat and warmth in cold. Bedouin dress—flowing robes, head coverings—protected against sun and sand. This mobile lifestyle required minimal possessions; social wealth lay in camels, kinship networks, and reputation. Bedouin knowledge of desert navigation, water sources, and survival was encyclopedic.</p>

            <h2>Tribal Society</h2>
            <p>Bedouin society is organized by genealogical tribes (qabīla) claiming descent from common ancestors. Tribes subdivide into clans and family groups in nested segmentary structure. Tribal identity determines allegiances, marriage possibilities, and access to territory. Leadership is earned rather than inherited—the sheikh proves himself through wisdom, generosity, and effectiveness. Honor (sharaf) is paramount: family honor must be defended, sometimes through blood feud. Conversely, hospitality (diyāfa) to guests—even strangers or enemies—is sacred obligation. Coffee ceremonies demonstrate hospitality and seal agreements. Women's roles center on household and weaving (tent cloths, rugs, bags); they have some autonomy within patriarchal structures. Oral poetry, recounting genealogies, battles, and loves, is the great Bedouin art form, preserving history and values.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Bedouin</h2>
            <p>Modern Bedouin have experienced radical transformation. Oil wealth transformed the Gulf states, offering Bedouin employment and settlement incentives. Israel's policies in the Negev have forcibly settled many Bedouin, destroying "unrecognized villages" and restricting grazing. Jordan, Syria, and Egypt have similarly pushed sedentarization. Most Bedouin now live in permanent settlements, though some maintain herds and seasonal movement. Traditional tribal structures persist but are embedded in modern states. Some Bedouin work in tourism (desert safaris, camel tours); others in military and security forces, valued for desert expertise. The romanticized "noble savage" image of Bedouin coexists with marginalization and discrimination. Climate change and development threaten remaining desert rangelands. Bedouin identity remains strong—tribal affiliation, hospitality codes, and desert heritage persist even among urbanized descendants.</p>
