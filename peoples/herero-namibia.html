            <h2>Who Are the Herero?</h2>
            <p>The Herero are a Bantu-speaking pastoral people of Namibia, Botswana, and Angola. Once powerful cattle herders dominating central Namibia, they suffered near-extermination in the 1904-1908 German genocide—the 20th century's first. From a pre-war population of 80,000, only 15,000 survived. Today, the Herero have rebuilt their communities while maintaining distinctive traditions, most visibly the elaborate Victorian-style dresses worn by women that have become symbols of cultural resilience and historical memory.</p>

            <h2>The Victorian Dress Tradition</h2>
            <p>Herero women wear spectacular long dresses (ohorokova) adapted from Victorian-era missionary styles, featuring voluminous skirts, puffed sleeves, and distinctive horn-shaped headdresses (otjikaiva) representing cattle horns. These outfits, requiring up to 12 meters of fabric, have transformed from colonial imposition into powerful cultural symbols. The headdress honors Herero cattle culture, while the dresses memorialize ancestors killed in the genocide. Women wear their finest dresses for funerals, honoring the dead while asserting cultural survival. The tradition demonstrates how colonized peoples can reclaim and transform imposed elements.</p>

            <h2>The Genocide of 1904-1908</h2>
            <p>In 1904, the Herero rose against German colonial rule after years of land theft and abuse. General Lothar von Trotha responded with an extermination order, driving survivors into the Omaheke Desert to die of thirst. Those captured were placed in concentration camps where thousands died of forced labor, disease, and medical experiments. The Nama people suffered similarly. Germany formally acknowledged this as genocide in 2021, offering apologies and development aid—though survivors' descendants reject the settlement as inadequate. The Herero continue seeking meaningful reparations and the return of ancestral remains held in German museums.</p>

            <h2>Cattle and Social Organization</h2>
            <p>Traditional Herero society centered on cattle, which provided sustenance, measured wealth, and held spiritual significance. The sacred fire (okuruwo) burns perpetually in each homestead, connecting living Herero to ancestors and cattle simultaneously. Social organization follows double descent—property passes through the father's line while ceremonial roles and sacred cattle pass through the mother's line. Despite the genocide devastating cattle herds and disrupting social structures, cattle remain central to Herero identity. Red ochre mixed with fat, traditionally applied to skin and hair, continues marking Herero identity.</p>

            <h2>Memory and Resilience</h2>
            <p>Annual commemorations, especially at the genocide memorial in Okahandja, bring Herero together to honor ancestors and assert survival. Men wear military-style uniforms mimicking German colonial soldiers—a subversive appropriation of oppressor imagery. These gatherings combine mourning, celebration, and political activism. The fight for reparations continues as central to Herero identity, with delegations traveling to Germany and pursuing legal cases. Through maintaining traditions, pursuing justice, and rebuilding community, the Herero demonstrate remarkable resilience following near-annihilation.</p>
