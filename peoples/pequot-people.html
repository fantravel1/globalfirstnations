            <h2>Who Are the Pequot?</h2>
            <p>The Pequot are an Algonquian-speaking people of Connecticut, today comprising two federally recognized tribes: the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation (~1,000 members) and the Eastern Pequot Tribal Nation (pending re-recognition). Their name means "Destroyers" or "The People of the Shallow Waters"—the former reflecting their military reputation before colonization. They speak a dialect of Mohegan-Pequot, now extinct as a first language. The Pequot experienced near-extinction in the Pequot War (1636-38), then remarkable resurgence through the gaming industry—the Foxwoods Resort Casino transformed them from a handful of survivors on tiny reservation into one of America's wealthiest tribes.</p>

            <h2>Pequot War</h2>
            <p>The Pequot War (1636-38) was one of the earliest and most brutal colonial conflicts in New England. English colonists, with Mohegan and Narragansett allies, attacked the Pequot for control of the Connecticut River valley and the wampum trade. The Mystic Massacre (1637) saw English soldiers burn a Pequot village, killing 400-700 people—mostly women, children, and elderly. Survivors were killed, enslaved, or absorbed into other tribes. Connecticut banned the name "Pequot"; the nation was declared destroyed. Yet small groups survived, eventually receiving a 214-acre reservation in 1666—one of America's oldest.</p>

            <h2>Foxwoods Revival</h2>
            <p>In 1976, the Mashantucket Pequot reservation held only two residents—Elizabeth George Plouffe and her half-sister. The tribe achieved federal recognition in 1983 and opened a bingo hall in 1986. Foxwoods Resort Casino (opened 1992) became the world's largest casino, generating billions annually at its peak. This extraordinary turnaround—from near-extinction to immense wealth—became a controversial model for tribal gaming. The tribe employed thousands, donated millions, and built the Mashantucket Pequot Museum—the world's largest Native American museum. Economic downturns and competition have since reduced revenues, but the gaming model transformed Indian Country.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Pequot</h2>
            <p>Modern Pequot navigate post-boom challenges. Foxwoods remains operational but faces competition from nearby casinos, including the Mohegan Sun. Debt accumulated during expansion years creates ongoing pressure. The Mashantucket Pequot Museum presents indigenous history to hundreds of thousands annually. Cultural programs work to preserve language and traditions. The Eastern Pequot, whose recognition was reversed in 2005, continue fighting for restoration. How the Mashantucket Pequot sustain tribal services as gaming revenues decline, while the Eastern Pequot seek recognition, shapes this resurrected people's future in their Connecticut homeland.</p>
