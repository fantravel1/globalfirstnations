            <h2>Who Are the Wolof?</h2>
            <p>The Wolof are the largest ethnic group in Senegal (43% of population) and also significant in The Gambia and Mauritania, numbering over 6 million people. They established powerful medieval kingdoms including the Jolof Empire (1350-1890), which dominated much of Senegambia. The Wolof language has become the lingua franca of Senegal, spoken by 80% of the population regardless of ethnicity. They are renowned for their sophisticated urban culture, distinctive griot tradition of oral history, elaborate textile arts, and contribution to West African music that has influenced global genres from Afrobeat to hip-hop.</p>

            <h2>The Jolof Empire and Historical Power</h2>
            <p>The **Jolof Empire** (also spelled Djolof) was a powerful West African state that united the Wolof kingdoms from approximately 1350 to 1549, and continued as a smaller kingdom until French colonization. At its height, the empire controlled trade routes across Senegambia and maintained diplomatic relations with European powers. The empire's dissolution led to successor states including Waalo, Cayor, Baol, and Sine-Saloum, each with its own **Buur** (king). The traditional Wolof social structure included nobles (garmi), warriors (ceddo), artisan castes (ñeeño) including griots, and formerly enslaved peoples. This hierarchical system, while modified, still influences Wolof society, with family names indicating caste origins.</p>

            <h2>Griot Tradition and Musical Heritage</h2>
            <p>The **griot** (géwël in Wolof) tradition represents one of Africa's most sophisticated systems of oral history and musical performance. Griots serve as historians, praise singers, musicians, and social mediators, with knowledge passed through hereditary lineages for centuries. They play traditional instruments including the **sabar** drums (distinctive tall drums played with one hand and one stick), the **kora** (21-string harp-lute), and the **xalam** (plucked lute ancestor of the banjo). Modern Wolof musicians like Youssou N'Dour have taken this heritage global, pioneering **mbalax** music that fuses traditional Wolof rhythms with international styles. The griot tradition of rhythmic storytelling also influenced the development of hip-hop through the African diaspora.</p>

            <h2>Islam and Cultural Synthesis</h2>
            <p>The Wolof are predominantly Muslim (95%+), with Islam arriving through trans-Saharan trade routes in the 11th century and becoming dominant by the 19th century through jihads and Sufi brotherhoods. The **Mouride** brotherhood, founded by Cheikh Ahmadou Bamba in 1883, is particularly influential among Wolof, with its holy city of Touba becoming Senegal's second-largest city. The **Grand Magal** pilgrimage brings 3+ million to Touba annually. However, Wolof Islam synthesizes with traditional beliefs: **marabouts** (Islamic scholars) incorporate traditional divination, protective amulets (gris-gris) remain common, and traditional naming ceremonies, wrestling (laamb), and social customs coexist with Islamic practice. This synthesis exemplifies successful religious adaptation while maintaining cultural identity.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Wolof Culture</h2>
            <p>Modern Wolof culture thrives in Senegal's urban centers, particularly Dakar, one of Africa's most vibrant cities. **Teranga** (hospitality) remains a defining value, with elaborate tea ceremonies and communal meals central to social life. Wolof fashion, particularly the flowing **boubou** robes and elaborate headdresses, influences African style internationally. Traditional **Wolof wrestling** (laamb) has become a national sport with celebrity wrestlers and packed stadiums. The language continues expanding, absorbing French loanwords while exporting terms globally (including "hip" from Wolof "hipi" meaning "to have one's eyes open"). Challenges include rapid urbanization straining traditional family structures, youth unemployment driving emigration, and climate change affecting traditional agriculture in Senegal's increasingly dry interior.</p>
