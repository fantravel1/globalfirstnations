            <h2>Who Are the Nahua People?</h2>
            <p>The Nahua (Nahuatl speakers) are Mexico's largest indigenous group with approximately 1.7 million speakers of Nahuatl, descendants of the Mexica (Aztecs) and other Nahua-speaking peoples who dominated Central Mexico before Spanish conquest. Recognized as one of Mexico's 68 constitutionally protected indigenous peoples, they maintain vibrant communities across central Mexico, particularly in Puebla, Veracruz, Hidalgo, and Guerrero states. The Nahua created sophisticated pre-Columbian civilizations including the Aztec Empire, developed advanced agriculture (chinampas), astronomy, writing systems, and urban planning. Today they navigate between traditional culture and modern Mexican society while maintaining Nahuatl language, agricultural traditions, religious practices blending indigenous and Catholic elements, and strong community governance.</p>

            <h2>Nahuatl Language and Linguistic Diversity</h2>
            <p>Nahuatl is a Uto-Aztecan language with over 30 distinct variants forming a dialect continuum across central Mexico. Classical Nahuatl was the lingua franca of Mesoamerica and the language of Aztec codices, poetry, and administration. Modern Nahuatl variants include Central Nahuatl (largest), Eastern Huasteca Nahuatl, Western Peripheral Nahuatl, and Pipil (El Salvador). The language contributed many words to Spanish and English: chocolate (xocolatl), tomato (tomatl), avocado (ahuacatl), coyote (coyotl), and chili (chilli). Despite historical suppression, Nahuatl remains Mexico's most widely spoken indigenous language, taught in some schools and universities, used in literature and music, and maintained through intergenerational transmission in rural communities.</p>

            <h2>Agricultural Heritage and Chinampa System</h2>
            <p>The Nahua developed chinampas ("floating gardens")—sophisticated raised-bed agriculture in shallow lakes producing multiple crops annually. This sustainable system fed millions in the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan and continues in Xochimilco today. Traditional crops include maize (multiple varieties), beans, squash (milpa system), amaranth, chia, and tomatoes. The nixtamalization process—treating maize with lime—unlocks nutrients and creates masa for tortillas, tamales, and other staples. Contemporary Nahua communities maintain traditional agricultural knowledge including crop rotation, seed saving, terracing on hillsides, and sustainable forest management. However, they face challenges from land loss, water scarcity, migration to cities, and pressure to adopt industrial agriculture.</p>

            <h2>Religious Syncretism and Traditional Practices</h2>
            <p>Modern Nahua spirituality blends pre-Columbian beliefs with Catholicism in complex syncretism. Traditional deities persist under Catholic saint identities: Tonantzin (Earth Mother) merged with Virgin of Guadalupe, Tlaloc (rain god) venerated through weather ceremonies, and Quetzalcoatl elements integrated into Christian narratives. Important ceremonies include Día de Muertos (Day of the Dead) honoring ancestors with ofrendas (altars), agricultural rituals for planting and harvest, pilgrimages to sacred mountains and springs, traditional healing with curanderos using medicinal plants, and xochitl (flower) ceremonies. Community governance often follows traditional cargos system where community members rotate civic-religious responsibilities.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Challenges and Cultural Revival</h2>
            <p>Nahua communities face significant challenges: poverty and marginalization in rural areas, discrimination and racism from mestizo society, loss of agricultural lands to development and mining, youth migration to cities and US, and language shift toward Spanish among younger generations. However, cultural revival movements are strengthening: Nahuatl language education programs in schools, publication of literature and poetry in Nahuatl, indigenous rights activism, cultural centers teaching traditional arts, and political organization for land rights and autonomy. Some communities have achieved recognition of traditional governance systems. The Nahua demonstrate resilience in maintaining identity while adapting to contemporary Mexico.</p>
