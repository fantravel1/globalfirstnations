            <h2>Who Are the Aché?</h2>
            <p>The Aché (also known as Guayaki) are a hunter-gatherer indigenous people of eastern Paraguay, speaking an isolated language sometimes classified as Tupí-Guaraní but quite divergent from other family members. Numbering approximately 1,500-2,000, the Aché lived as nomadic forest hunters until the 1960s-1970s, when the last bands were contacted and settled. Their recent transition from foraging to settled life has made them important for anthropological understanding of hunter-gatherer societies. The Aché experienced genocidal violence during contact, including enslavement and massacres, which reduced their population dramatically. Today they live in several settlements, balancing traditional practices with integration into Paraguayan society.</p>

            <h2>Forest Hunters</h2>
            <p>Until recently, the Aché lived as fully nomadic hunter-gatherers in the subtropical forests of eastern Paraguay. Bands of 15-70 people moved constantly through the forest, hunting with bows and arrow, collecting wild honey, palm hearts, and larvae. Men specialized in hunting large game (peccary, tapir, deer); women gathered plant foods and smaller animals. Food sharing was highly egalitarian—meat was distributed throughout the band. Material culture was minimal; possessions were limited to what could be carried during daily movements. This mobile lifeway required extensive forest habitat, which was progressively destroyed by agricultural expansion, bringing the Aché into conflict with settlers and eventually forcing contact.</p>

            <h2>Genocidal Contact</h2>
            <p>Aché contact history is marked by extreme violence. As settlers encroached on their forests, the Aché retreated but suffered attacks, enslavement of children, and massacres. Some Aché were hunted like game animals by settlers and soldiers. Missionaries and anthropologists attempted to establish peaceful contact from the 1960s; the last forest bands were contacted by the mid-1970s. Population had plummeted from perhaps 3,000-5,000 to under 1,000 due to violence and epidemic disease. The Aché case became internationally known as an example of ongoing genocide against indigenous peoples, prompting advocacy and eventual legal actions, though perpetrators were never prosecuted.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Aché</h2>
            <p>Modern Aché live in several settlements on demarcated lands. The transition from nomadic hunting to sedentary life occurred within living memory—many adults remember forest life. Agriculture now provides subsistence, supplemented by wage labor and forest resources where available. Traditional skills persist but are increasingly irrelevant to settled life. Extensive anthropological research (notably by Kim Hill and others) has documented Aché lifeways, behavioral ecology, and cultural change. Some settlements have developed sustainable forestry and ecotourism initiatives. The Aché language is endangered as youth increasingly speak only Spanish. Cultural knowledge remains with elders, but transmission is uncertain. The Aché represent one of the world's most recently contacted peoples, still processing a traumatic transition from autonomous forest life to integration into modern society.</p>
