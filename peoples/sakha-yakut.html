            <h2>Who Are the Sakha?</h2>
            <p>The Sakha, also known as Yakut, are a Turkic-speaking people native to the Sakha Republic (Yakutia) in northeastern Siberia, Russia. They inhabit the coldest permanently inhabited region on Earth, where temperatures can plummet to -60°C (-76°F). Despite these extreme conditions, the Sakha have developed a sophisticated culture centered around horse and cattle breeding, adapting their livestock and lifestyles to thrive in the frozen taiga and tundra.</p>
            <p>Their origins trace to Turkic migrations from the Lake Baikal region around the 13th-14th centuries. The Sakha brought with them horse culture to the Arctic, developing the cold-resistant Yakutian horse breed that can survive without shelter in temperatures that would kill other horses.</p>

            </div>

            <h2>Survival in Extreme Cold</h2>
            <p>The Sakha have developed remarkable adaptations for living in extreme cold. Traditional dwellings called balagan are log cabins built low to the ground, heavily insulated with mud and manure, with small windows to retain heat. Modern Yakutsk, the regional capital, is the coldest major city in the world, where buildings must be constructed on stilts above permafrost.</p>
            <p>Traditional clothing includes elaborately decorated fur coats, hats, and boots. The Sakha winter wardrobe features multiple layers of animal skins and furs, with each layer serving specific insulation functions. Reindeer and horse hides provide outer protection, while inner layers use softer furs.</p>

            <h2>Horse Culture of the Arctic</h2>
            <p>The Yakutian horse is central to Sakha identity, representing one of humanity's most remarkable feats of animal domestication. These horses can survive temperatures of -60°C by growing thick coats up to 10 cm long and developing unique metabolic adaptations. They dig through snow to find grass and can survive on minimal food during the long winter.</p>
            <p>Horse meat and mare's milk products remain staples of traditional cuisine. Kumis (fermented mare's milk) and stroganina (frozen raw fish or meat shaved into thin strips) are iconic dishes. The Sakha also raise hardy Yakutian cattle, which produce milk even in extreme cold.</p>

            <h2>Spiritual Traditions</h2>
            <p>Traditional Sakha religion, Aiyy, centers on reverence for nature spirits and ancestors. The religion includes a complex cosmology with multiple spirit worlds and a creator deity. Shamanism played a central role, with shamans serving as intermediaries between human and spirit realms.</p>
            <p>The Yhyakh festival, celebrated during the summer solstice, is the most important Sakha holiday. It includes traditional round dances (ohuokhai), kumis ceremonies, horse racing, and performances of the olonkho epic poetry, which UNESCO recognizes as a Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Life</h2>
            <p>Today, the Sakha Republic is the largest subnational entity in the world by area. The Sakha maintain strong cultural identity while integrating modern technology. Diamond mining has become economically significant, with the region producing about 25% of the world's diamonds. However, climate change poses serious threats as permafrost thaw destabilizes buildings and infrastructure.</p>
