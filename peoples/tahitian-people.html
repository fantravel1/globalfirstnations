            <h2>Who Are the Tahitian?</h2>
            <p>The Tahitian (Mā'ohi) are the indigenous Polynesian people of Tahiti and the Society Islands in French Polynesia, numbering approximately 180,000. They speak Tahitian (Reo Tahiti), an Eastern Polynesian language that served as a lingua franca across much of eastern Polynesia. Tahiti holds a special place in Pacific history—it was from here and nearby islands that ancient navigators launched voyages that colonized Hawaii, New Zealand, and Easter Island. European contact, beginning with Samuel Wallis in 1767, transformed Tahiti into a symbol of Pacific paradise in Western imagination, a reputation that brought both romanticization and colonization.</p>

            <h2>Voyaging Heritage</h2>
            <p>Ancient Tahitians were master navigators who explored and settled vast reaches of the Pacific. Using double-hulled voyaging canoes (va'a), they navigated by stars, ocean swells, bird flights, and other natural signs across thousands of miles of open ocean. Tahiti sat at the heart of a voyaging network connecting the Society Islands with the Tuamotus, Marquesas, Cook Islands, and beyond. The great navigator Tupaia, who joined Captain Cook's expedition, demonstrated extraordinary geographic knowledge. Traditional society was hierarchically organized with sacred chiefs (ari'i), priests, and commoners. The marae (stone temple platforms) served as religious and political centers. Tahiti's central Pacific location made it a crossroads of Polynesian culture.</p>

            <h2>Colonial Transformations</h2>
            <p>European contact dramatically transformed Tahitian society. The arrival of the London Missionary Society in 1797 began the conversion to Christianity and suppression of traditional religion. King Pomare II's conversion in 1812 marked a turning point. France established a protectorate in 1842 and formally annexed Tahiti in 1880. French colonial policies promoted assimilation and French language, while Tahitian culture was marginalized. Nuclear testing in French Polynesia (1966-1996) brought infrastructure and French workers but also environmental concerns and anti-colonial sentiment. Throughout colonization, Tahitians maintained elements of their culture—language, dance, music, and connection to the land and sea persisted despite pressures toward French cultural assimilation.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Tahitian</h2>
            <p>Modern Tahitian culture is experiencing revival alongside ongoing debates about political status. The Tahitian language, while official alongside French, faces pressure from French dominance. Cultural renaissance movements have revived traditional dance (especially 'ori Tahiti), music, tattooing, and navigation. The Heiva festival each July celebrates Tahitian culture through dance, music, and traditional sports. Voyaging canoe revivals have reconnected Tahitians with their navigational heritage. Tourism dominates the economy, bringing both opportunity and cultural commodification. Independence movements advocate for sovereignty, while others prefer continued association with France. Tahitians navigate between French citizenship, Pacific identity, and indigenous heritage, maintaining distinctive culture while engaging with globalization.</p>
