            <h2>Who Are the Mentawai?</h2>
            <p>The Mentawai are an indigenous people of the Mentawai Islands, a remote archipelago off the western coast of Sumatra, Indonesia. Numbering approximately 60,000-70,000, they inhabit the islands of Siberut, Sipora, North Pagai, and South Pagai. The Mentawai speak Mentawai, an Austronesian language distinct from mainland Sumatran languages, reflecting their isolation. Known for their elaborate tattoos, flower decorations, and traditional religious practices, the Mentawai maintained a remarkably intact indigenous culture until recent decades. Their Sabulungan animist religion, uma (longhouse) social organization, and distinctive material culture make them one of Indonesia's most culturally distinctive indigenous groups.</p>

            <h2>Tattoo Culture</h2>
            <p>Mentawai tattoos are among the most elaborate indigenous tattoo traditions in the world. Traditional tattooing covered much of the body in distinctive patterns using designs specific to clan, gender, and achievement. The process used hand-tapped needles and natural pigments. Tattoos served spiritual functions: they identified the soul so ancestors could recognize the deceased; they displayed beauty and status; they marked transitions and accomplishments. Women's and men's tattoos differed in placement and design. Missionaries and government policies suppressed tattooing from the early 20th century; by the 1980s, few young people received traditional tattoos. Recent cultural revival has renewed interest, though most fully tattooed individuals are now elderly. Mentawai tattoos have inspired global tattoo art.</p>

            <h2>Sabulungan Religion</h2>
            <p>Traditional Mentawai religion, Sabulungan, is an animist system centered on maintaining harmony with spirits (kina) inhabiting all things. The sikerei (shaman/healer) mediates between human and spirit worlds through trance, ritual, and herbal medicine. Ceremonies involve music, dance, offerings, and animal sacrifice—pigs and chickens are essential ritual animals. The uma (longhouse) serves as both residence and ceremonial center for extended families. Rituals mark life transitions, heal illness, ensure hunting success, and appease spirits. Flowers worn in the hair and decorative plants are not merely aesthetic but spiritually significant. The Indonesian government pressured Mentawai to convert to official religions (Islam, Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism); many converted nominally while maintaining traditional practices. Cultural revival has strengthened Sabulungan's practice and recognition.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Mentawai</h2>
            <p>Modern Mentawai navigate between tradition and modernity. Siberut island, with much of the population and the most intact traditional communities, was designated a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. Tourism has grown, with visitors seeking "authentic" encounters with traditional culture; some communities perform traditional practices for tourists. This tourism generates income but raises questions about authenticity and exploitation. Logging and palm oil have damaged forests; the 2010 earthquake and tsunami devastated some communities. Education and Christianity have spread; younger generations often prefer modern dress and lifestyles. Yet cultural identity remains strong. The Mentawai language survives; traditional skills are taught; sikerei continue practicing. The Mentawai demonstrate the tensions facing isolated indigenous communities between preserving heritage and participating in the modern economy.</p>
