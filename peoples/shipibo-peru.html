            <h2>Who Are the Shipibo-Konibo?</h2>
            <p>The Shipibo-Konibo (often just Shipibo) are an indigenous people of approximately 35,000 inhabiting the Ucayali River region of the Peruvian Amazon. They speak Shipibo-Konibo, a Panoan language, and are renowned for their distinctive geometric art (kené), ayahuasca healing traditions, and sophisticated understanding of plant medicine. Their intricate designs—appearing on textiles, pottery, skin, and body—are said to represent the cosmic patterns revealed through ayahuasca visions. The global ayahuasca tourism industry has brought both economic opportunities and challenges to Shipibo communities, as their sacred medicine traditions attract seekers worldwide.</p>

            <h2>Kené Art</h2>
            <p>Kené is the distinctive Shipibo geometric design system—intricate patterns of lines, angles, and curves that appear throughout their material culture. Women traditionally learn kené from childhood, developing individual styles within established conventions. These designs aren't merely decorative; they represent the fundamental patterns of the universe, revealed through ayahuasca visions. Kené appears on textiles (the famous Shipibo cloth), ceramics, body paint, and now commercial art. Each design is unique, encoding spiritual information. The tradition has gained international recognition; Shipibo textiles sell globally. Yet commercialization raises concerns about meaning dilution and fair compensation.</p>

            <h2>Ayahuasca Traditions</h2>
            <p>The Shipibo are among the Amazon's most renowned ayahuasca practitioners. Onanya (healers/shamans) use the visionary brew—combining the ayahuasca vine and chacruna leaves—for diagnosis, healing, and spiritual insight. Healing ceremonies involve icaros (sacred songs) that the onanya learns from plants during apprenticeship; these songs guide the ceremony and direct healing energy. Shipibo onanya are sought by ayahuasca tourists worldwide, creating a complex economy: income for communities but also exploitation, cultural appropriation, and sometimes dangerous practices by inadequately trained foreigners claiming expertise. Managing this globalization of sacred tradition poses ongoing challenges.</p>

            <h2>Plant Knowledge</h2>
            <p>Beyond ayahuasca, Shipibo possess extensive ethnobotanical knowledge—identifying hundreds of plants for medicine, food, craft, and spiritual purposes. The "plant dieta" tradition involves isolation and restrictions while developing relationships with specific plants, learning their healing properties through direct experience. This knowledge system, developed over millennia, represents irreplaceable intellectual heritage. Bioprospecting by pharmaceutical companies has raised concerns about biopiracy—using indigenous knowledge without consent or compensation. The Shipibo case highlights tensions between traditional knowledge, intellectual property, and global commercialization of indigenous medicine.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Shipibo</h2>
            <p>Modern Shipibo navigate complex pressures: ayahuasca tourism brings income but commodifies sacred practices; logging and oil extraction threaten territories; urbanization draws youth to cities. Many Shipibo have migrated to Lima's Cantagallo community, maintaining identity in urban context. Cultural organizations promote language and arts; women's cooperatives sell textiles directly. Land titling efforts seek to protect territories from extractive industries. How Shipibo manage sacred tradition's globalization, protect territorial rights, and maintain cultural integrity amid rapid change defines their contemporary challenges. Their artistic and spiritual traditions have global resonance while remaining distinctly Amazonian.</p>
