            <h2>Who Are the Kikuyu?</h2>
            <p>The Kikuyu (Gikuyu) are Kenya's largest ethnic group, comprising approximately 22% of Kenya's 55 million population (12 million). They inhabit the fertile Central Highlands around Mount Kenya (Kirinyaga), their sacred mountain where Ngai (God) dwells. The Kikuyu practiced intensive agriculture before British colonization; their densely populated lands attracted settler appropriation, making them central to Kenya's independence struggle. Four of Kenya's presidents have been Kikuyu, and the community dominates commerce and politics—generating both their prominence and ethnic tensions that periodically erupt in Kenyan society.</p>

            <h2>Mount Kenya</h2>
            <p>Mount Kenya (Kirinyaga—"Place of Light") is sacred to the Kikuyu. Ngai, the supreme deity, dwells on its glaciated peaks. Traditional prayers faced the mountain; sacrifices were offered at designated sacred groves. The mountain shapes Kikuyu cosmology, calendar, and identity. Homes traditionally faced Kirinyaga. When missionaries arrived, they leveraged existing monotheism to present Christianity, achieving significant conversions. Today, most Kikuyu are Christian but maintain cultural reverence for the mountain. The relationship between spiritual traditions, Christianity, and cultural identity continues evolving among contemporary Kikuyu.</p>

            <h2>Mau Mau Uprising</h2>
            <p>The Mau Mau Uprising (1952-1960) was primarily a Kikuyu armed resistance against British colonialism and land dispossession. Colonial authorities branded it terrorist and detained over 1.5 million Kikuyu; torture and atrocities characterized suppression camps. Perhaps 25,000 Kikuyu died. The British finally acknowledged abuses in 2013, paying compensation to survivors. Mau Mau fighters are now honored as freedom heroes in Kenya, though the movement's legacy remains complex—it was also partly civil war among Kikuyu. The uprising demonstrated resistance to colonialism and shaped Kenya's path to independence in 1963.</p>

            <h2>Political Dominance</h2>
            <p>Kikuyu have dominated Kenyan politics: Jomo Kenyatta (founding president), Mwai Kibaki, and Uhuru Kenyatta were all Kikuyu, as is current Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua. This dominance reflects demographic weight, early embrace of education, and accumulated economic resources. Other ethnic groups resent perceived Kikuyu advantages; ethnic violence has periodically targeted Kikuyu, particularly in 2007-2008 post-election violence. The question of ethnic politics—whether Kenya can develop non-ethnic political identities—remains central to national stability. Kikuyu navigate being simultaneously dominant and targets of ethnic resentment.</p>

            <h2>Entrepreneurial Culture</h2>
            <p>Kikuyu are renowned for entrepreneurial orientation. From colonial-era adoption of cash crops to contemporary business dominance, Kikuyu have excelled commercially. Nairobi's economy is substantially Kikuyu-controlled. Cultural values emphasizing hard work, education, and achievement contribute to commercial success. Trade networks extend throughout Kenya and the diaspora. This economic prominence generates both wealth and ethnic tension. Kikuyu success stories are celebrated within the community while sometimes resented externally. How economic inequality maps onto ethnic lines shapes Kenya's social dynamics.</p>
