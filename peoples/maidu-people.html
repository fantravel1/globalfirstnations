            <h2>Who Are the Maidu?</h2>
            <p>The Maidu are an indigenous people of northeastern California, with approximately 3,000 enrolled members across several federally recognized tribes—Greenville Rancheria, Susanville Indian Rancheria, Mooretown Rancheria, Enterprise Rancheria, and the Konkow Valley Band of Maidu. They speak Maiduan languages (Penutian family)—Maidu, Konkow, and Nisenan—all critically endangered. Their territory spans the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada from the American River north to Lassen Peak, encompassing foothill oak woodlands, montane forests, and high country. The Maidu were acorn-dependent people who developed sophisticated processing techniques to render tannic acorns edible and nutritious.</p>

            <h2>Acorn Culture</h2>
            <p>Acorns were the foundation of Maidu subsistence. Black oak acorns, gathered in fall and stored in granaries, provided the staple food. Processing required extensive labor: cracking shells, grinding in bedrock mortars (still visible throughout Maidu territory), and leaching tannins through repeated water baths. The resulting meal was cooked into soup or mush. Maidu managed oak groves through controlled burning, promoting acorn production while clearing understory. Beyond acorns, they harvested pine nuts, roots, seeds, and greens; hunted deer and smaller game; and fished salmon and trout. Each village maintained territories and resource rights. This sophisticated land management supported populations of perhaps 9,000.</p>

            <h2>Gold Rush Catastrophe</h2>
            <p>The California Gold Rush (1848-1855) devastated Maidu peoples. Miners flooded their territory; hydraulic mining destroyed streams and salmon runs. Violence was systematic—settlers and militias killed Indians with impunity, sometimes with state funding. The Konkow Trail of Tears (1863) forcibly marched Konkow Maidu from their homeland to Round Valley Reservation—many died en route. Survivors scattered to marginal lands, worked on ranches, or hid in remote areas. Population collapsed from perhaps 9,000 to fewer than 1,000. Small rancherías provided minimal land; termination (1950s) ended federal recognition for some. Restoration came gradually beginning in the 1980s.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Maidu</h2>
            <p>Modern Maidu communities pursue cultural revitalization while addressing economic challenges. Several tribes operate gaming facilities; others remain economically marginal. Language programs work to document and transmit Maiduan languages; the Maidu Summit Consortium coordinates cultural preservation across tribal lines. Traditional arts—particularly basket weaving—continue; the annual Big Time gathering at Greenville brings communities together. Fire stewardship, informed by traditional burning practices, addresses forest health and wildfire risk in partnership with land managers. The Konkow Valley Band seeks federal recognition. How Maidu restore languages, protect cultural landscapes, and strengthen intertribal connections shapes these acorn people's future in their Sierra homeland.</p>
