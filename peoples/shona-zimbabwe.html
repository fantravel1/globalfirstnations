            <h2>Who Are the Shona?</h2>
            <p>The Shona are the largest ethnic group of Zimbabwe, comprising approximately 80% of its 15 million population (12 million), with additional communities in Mozambique. They speak Shona, a Bantu language with multiple dialects including Karanga, Zezuru, Korekore, and Manyika. The Shona built Great Zimbabwe, the largest ancient stone structure in sub-Saharan Africa south of the Nile—a civilization that challenged European assumptions about African capabilities. Known for spiritual traditions centering on ancestral spirits (mhondoro) and their globally renowned stone sculpture tradition, Shona culture represents Zimbabwe's dominant heritage.</p>

            <h2>Great Zimbabwe</h2>
            <p>Great Zimbabwe (11th-15th centuries) was a powerful state whose stone ruins—built without mortar—remain southern Africa's largest ancient structure. At its peak, Great Zimbabwe controlled gold trade with Swahili coast ports; its population reached perhaps 18,000. European colonizers initially refused to believe Africans built it, inventing theories of Phoenician or Arab origins—a racist denial thoroughly debunked by archaeology. The modern nation took its name from this heritage; the Zimbabwe Bird from the ruins became the national symbol. Great Zimbabwe represents proof of sophisticated African civilization before European contact.</p>

            <h2>Ancestral Spirits</h2>
            <p>Traditional Shona religion centers on vadzimu (ancestral spirits) and mhondoro (royal spirits) who mediate between the living and Mwari (the supreme deity). Spirit mediums (svikiro) become possessed by mhondoro, providing guidance, healing, and governance. During Zimbabwe's liberation war (1964-1979), spirit mediums played significant roles legitimizing the struggle as ancestral will. Though Christianity is now dominant, belief in ancestral spirits persists, often syncretically blended with Christian practice. The spirit world remains a dimension of Shona reality affecting health, fortune, and proper behavior.</p>

            <h2>Mbira Music</h2>
            <p>The mbira dzavadzimu ("voice of the ancestors") is the Shona's sacred instrument—a lamellophone with metal keys mounted on a wooden soundboard, played inside a resonating gourd. Mbira music accompanies all-night ceremonies (bira) intended to contact ancestral spirits; complex polyrhythms create trance-inducing soundscapes. Each piece has specific spiritual associations. While missionaries condemned mbira as pagan, it has experienced global revival. Artists like Thomas Mapfumo brought mbira-influenced music international recognition. UNESCO inscribed mbira-making and playing as Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2020.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Zimbabwe</h2>
            <p>As Zimbabwe's majority, Shona dominate national politics—both the ruling ZANU-PF and much opposition are Shona-led. Tensions with the minority Ndebele, particularly the 1980s Gukurahundi massacres, mark Zimbabwe's troubled post-independence history. Economic collapse under Mugabe, hyperinflation, and land reform controversies affected all Zimbabweans. Shona cultural revival includes language promotion, traditional medicine, and arts—the Shona sculpture movement has achieved international recognition. The diaspora, driven by economic crisis, maintains connections while navigating exile. Zimbabwe's future remains uncertain, but Shona culture persists as its foundation.</p>
