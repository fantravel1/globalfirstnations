            <h2>Who Are the Baluch?</h2>
            <p>The Baluch (also Baloch) are an Iranian ethnic group numbering approximately 15-20 million across Balochistan—a region divided between Pakistan (where they're about 4% of the population), Iran (2%), and Afghanistan. They speak Baluchi, a Northwestern Iranian language. Historically semi-nomadic pastoralists in the harsh deserts and mountains of Balochistan, the Baluch developed distinctive tribal organization, oral poetry traditions, and fierce independence. Their homeland—Pakistan's largest and least populated province—contains significant natural resources but remains underdeveloped, fueling separatist movements seeking greater autonomy or independence.</p>

            <h2>Tribal Organization</h2>
            <p>Baluch society organizes around tribes (baloch) led by sardars (chiefs) whose authority derives from lineage, wealth, and leadership ability. Tribes provide identity, protection, and social structure; loyalty to tribe often supersedes national identity. Tribal councils (jirga) resolve disputes through customary law. The Baluch code of honor emphasizes hospitality (melmastia), revenge, and courage. Marriage customs, often involving bride-price, cement alliances between families. While urbanization and state power have weakened tribal structures, they remain significant, especially in rural areas. Pakistani and Iranian governments have alternatively worked with and suppressed tribal authorities.</p>

            <h2>Resource Conflict</h2>
            <p>Balochistan contains significant natural resources—natural gas (Pakistan's largest reserves), coal, copper, gold—yet the region remains Pakistan's poorest province. Baluch complain that resources are extracted while benefits flow elsewhere; the Sui gas field has supplied Pakistan for decades while local communities lack access. The Gwadar port and China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) bring development but also displacement and Chinese/Punjabi influence resented by locals. Armed separatist groups have targeted infrastructure and security forces. This resource curse—poverty amid plenty, development without local benefit—drives Baluch grievances and insurgency.</p>

            <h2>Insurgency and Repression</h2>
            <p>Baluch insurgencies have erupted periodically since Pakistan's creation (1947). The current insurgency, ongoing since 2004, involves separatist groups fighting for independence or autonomy. Pakistani security forces have responded with military operations, enforced disappearances, and alleged extrajudicial killings. Human rights organizations document widespread abuses. Iran's Baluch minority faces similar repression. The conflict receives limited international attention; Baluch activists seek to raise awareness. Caught between insurgent violence, state repression, and extremist groups, civilian Baluch suffer most. Resolution remains distant as underlying grievances—marginalization, resource exploitation, rights violations—persist.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Baluch</h2>
            <p>Modern Baluch face stark challenges. Balochistan's development indicators—literacy, healthcare, poverty—are Pakistan's worst. The insurgency creates insecurity; educated youth emigrate. Traditional nomadic pastoralism declines as rangeland degrades and borders harden. Baluch culture—poetry, music, embroidery, carpet-weaving—endures but faces modernization pressures. Diaspora communities in the Gulf states and West organize politically. How Baluch navigate between integration into Pakistan/Iran (risking cultural loss) and armed resistance (bringing devastation) represents an unresolved crisis. Their future depends on whether states offer genuine autonomy and development or continued repression.</p>
