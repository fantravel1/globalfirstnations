            <h2>Who Are the Nuristani?</h2>
            <p>The Nuristani are an indigenous people of the Hindu Kush mountains in northeastern Afghanistan and northwestern Pakistan. Numbering approximately 150,000, they speak a unique branch of the Indo-Iranian language family and maintained their pre-Islamic polytheistic religion until forced conversion in 1896. Their homeland, previously called "Kafiristan" (Land of the Unbelievers), was renamed "Nuristan" (Land of Light) after Islamization.</p>
            <p>The Nuristani's remote mountain valleys preserved ancient Indo-European religious practices, elaborate woodcarving traditions, and a distinctive social system for millennia. Their culture offers glimpses into beliefs and customs that may have been widespread across the region before the spread of Islam, making them of great interest to historians and anthropologists.</p>

            <h2>The Ancient Religion</h2>
            <p>Pre-Islamic Nuristani religion was polytheistic, featuring a pantheon of gods associated with natural phenomena, war, and fertility. The supreme deity Imra (or Mara) ruled over other gods including Gish (war), Bagisht (water), and Dizane (fertility). Wooden effigies of gods and ancestors filled temples and sacred groves. Animal sacrifice, particularly of goats, was central to worship.</p>
            <p>Religious specialists included prophets who received divine visions and shamans who communicated with spirits. Elaborate festivals marked seasonal cycles and honored the gods. The dead were placed in wooden coffins above ground, and ancestor worship played an important role. These practices showed remarkable parallels to ancient Vedic and Greek religions.</p>

            <h2>Woodcarving and Architecture</h2>
            <p>Nuristani woodcarving represents one of the world's most elaborate traditions. Temples, houses, and everyday objects were covered with intricate carved designs featuring geometric patterns, animal figures, and human forms. Carved wooden pillars supported multi-story houses built into steep mountainsides.</p>
            <p>The distinctive Nuristani house featured a central hearth with carved pillars, with smoke escaping through a hole in the roof. Wealthy families displayed carved ancestor effigies and trophies from raids. Funeral effigies of prominent men were placed on hillsides, some of which survived into the 20th century before being destroyed or collected by museums.</p>

            <h2>The 1896 Conquest</h2>
            <p>Afghan Amir Abdur Rahman Khan conquered Kafiristan in 1895-96, forcibly converting the population to Islam. Temples were destroyed, sacred groves cut down, and effigies burned. Those who resisted were killed or enslaved. The conquest was framed as jihad, bringing the last non-Muslim region of the Hindu Kush into the Islamic fold.</p>
            <p>Despite forced conversion, elements of pre-Islamic culture persisted for generations. Woodcarving traditions continued, festivals were adapted to Islamic occasions, and some beliefs went underground. Even today, Nuristani culture retains distinctive elements that set it apart from surrounding Afghan and Pakistani societies.</p>

            <h2>Modern Challenges</h2>
            <p>Nuristan has been devastated by decades of war. Soviet invasion, civil war, Taliban rule, and ongoing conflict have destroyed infrastructure, displaced populations, and disrupted traditional life. The region's remoteness and difficult terrain have made it a refuge for various armed groups.</p>
            <p>Traditional woodcarving has declined as old-growth forests are depleted and master carvers pass away. Ancient carved pieces continue to appear in the international antiquities market, often looted from villages during periods of instability. Efforts to document and preserve Nuristani heritage face enormous challenges in the ongoing conflict zone.</p>
