            <h2>Who Are the Yupik?</h2>
            <p>The Yupik are indigenous peoples of Alaska and the Russian Far East, comprising several related groups including the Central Alaskan Yup'ik (the largest group, approximately 24,000), Siberian Yupik (approximately 1,700), and Cup'ik. They speak Yupik languages of the Eskimo-Aleut family, distinct from Inuit languages though related. The Yupik have inhabited the coastal and riverine regions of western Alaska and the Chukotka Peninsula for thousands of years, developing sophisticated maritime hunting cultures adapted to the challenging Arctic and subarctic environment. Unlike the Inuit who spread across the Arctic, Yupik peoples remained concentrated around the Bering Sea.</p>

            <h2>Maritime Hunting Culture</h2>
            <p>Traditional Yupik economy centered on marine mammal hunting—seals, walruses, and whales—supplemented by fishing (especially salmon), hunting caribou and birds, and gathering berries and plants. Coastal Yupik developed sophisticated sea ice hunting techniques, using kayaks (qayaq) and umiaks (large skin boats) for open water. They created ingenious tools including toggling harpoons, floats made from inflated seal bladders, and waterproof clothing from gut. Villages were semi-permanent, with communal houses called qasgiq serving as ceremonial and gathering spaces. Seasonal movements followed animal migrations—to fish camps in summer, seal hunting areas in spring. This maritime adaptation sustained dense populations along the Bering Sea coast.</p>

            <h2>Ceremonies and Beliefs</h2>
            <p>Yupik spirituality centers on relationships with animals, particularly sea mammals believed to possess spirits that must be respected. The Bladder Festival (Nakaciuq) returned seal bladders to the sea, allowing seal spirits to be reborn. The Messenger Feast involved elaborate exchanges between villages. Masked dances (yuraq) enacted spirit world interactions, with intricate wooden masks representing spirits, animals, and transformational beings. Shamans (angalkuq) mediated between human and spirit worlds, healing illness and ensuring hunting success. These ceremonies maintained balance between humans and the animal world upon which survival depended. Russian Orthodox Christianity, introduced in the 18th-19th centuries, merged with traditional beliefs rather than replacing them.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Yupik</h2>
            <p>Modern Yupik communities maintain strong cultural identity while navigating contemporary challenges. Central Yup'ik remains one of the most vital Alaska Native languages, with children still learning it as a first language in some communities, though language shift to English accelerates. Subsistence hunting and fishing remain central to both economy and identity, though regulated by complex federal and state laws. Climate change profoundly affects Yupik communities—melting permafrost threatens villages, changing ice conditions alter hunting, and shifting animal populations disrupt traditional practices. Some villages face relocation. Yet Yupik dance groups, language programs, and cultural organizations work to transmit traditions. Yupik people navigate between honoring ancestral ways and adapting to a rapidly changing Arctic.</p>
