            <h2>Who Are the Tohono O'odham?</h2>
            <p>The Tohono O'odham ("Desert People") are a Native American nation inhabiting the Sonoran Desert of southern Arizona and northern Sonora, Mexico. Numbering approximately 34,000 enrolled members, they constitute the second-largest tribe in Arizona. Formerly called "Papago" (from the Spanish rendering of a derogatory term meaning "bean eaters"), they officially reclaimed their traditional name in 1986. They speak Tohono O'odham, an Uto-Aztecan language closely related to Pima (Akimel O'odham, "River People"). The Tohono O'odham adapted remarkably to the harsh Sonoran Desert, developing strategies to survive in one of North America's hottest and driest regions. The US-Mexico border now divides their traditional territory, creating unique challenges for this transborder nation.</p>

            <h2>Desert Adaptation</h2>
            <p>Traditional Tohono O'odham life was organized around the desert's seasonal rhythms. In summer, people lived in "field villages" near floodwater-fed fields where they grew tepary beans, corn, and squash using ak-chin (floodwater) farming—planting at the mouths of washes where monsoon rains pooled. In winter, they moved to "well villages" near permanent water sources, hunting and gathering. The saguaro cactus was central: its fruit (bahidaj), harvested in June, was eaten fresh, dried, and fermented into wine (nawait) for ceremonies to bring rain. This wine ceremony (nawait i'idag) continues today. The Tohono O'odham developed encyclopedic knowledge of desert plants—over 200 species were used for food, medicine, or tools. This sophisticated adaptation allowed survival where others could not.</p>

            <h2>Divided by the Border</h2>
            <p>The 1853 Gadsden Purchase drew an international boundary through Tohono O'odham territory, eventually dividing the nation. Tribal members on both sides of the border continued to cross freely for ceremonies, family visits, and economic activities. Recent border militarization has dramatically affected the community. The US-Mexico border wall now cuts through the reservation, blocking traditional movements and sacred sites. Customs enforcement has complicated travel for Mexican O'odham to ceremonies at the tribal seat in Sells, Arizona. The tribe issues its own ID cards, but these are not always accepted by border agents. Drug and human smuggling across the remote reservation has brought violence and federal law enforcement. Some tribal members have been detained as undocumented despite ancestral presence predating national borders. The Tohono O'odham experience illustrates how indigenous sovereignty conflicts with national border security.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Tohono O'odham</h2>
            <p>Modern Tohono O'odham face economic challenges—the reservation is remote, with limited employment. Gaming (Desert Diamond Casino near Tucson) provides significant tribal revenue but is distant from many residents. Health issues, particularly diabetes (at epidemic rates), reflect dietary changes from traditional foods. Traditional diet revival programs promote tepary beans and other native foods. The language is endangered; most fluent speakers are over 50, though immersion programs exist. The saguaro wine ceremony and other traditions continue. Tohono O'odham basketry—tightly coiled yucca and bear grass baskets—is internationally collected. The tribe has opposed border wall construction through traditional territory, including sacred sites like Quitobaquito Springs. Political advocacy addresses both domestic issues (healthcare, education, employment) and the unique challenges of being a nation divided by an increasingly militarized international boundary.</p>
