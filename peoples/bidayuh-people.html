            <h2>Who Are the Bidayuh?</h2>
            <p>The Bidayuh are an indigenous people of Sarawak, Malaysia, and adjacent Kalimantan, Indonesia, numbering approximately 250,000. Often called "Land Dayaks" (as opposed to "Sea Dayaks" or Iban), they inhabit the hilly interior of southwestern Sarawak. The Bidayuh comprise multiple subgroups speaking related but distinct Austronesian languages. They traditionally lived in longhouses and practiced rice cultivation. Unlike the Iban, the Bidayuh generally did not practice headhunting. Today they are Sarawak's second-largest indigenous group after the Iban.</p>

            <h2>Baruk Head House</h2>
            <p>The baruk (also barook) is a distinctive Bidayuh structure—a circular or octagonal building raised on stilts, traditionally located at the center of the village. The baruk served as a meeting place for village elders, a ceremonial center, and historically, a place to store enemy heads taken in warfare. Though headhunting ended in the late 19th century, preserved skulls remained in baruk for generations. The structure represents Bidayuh social and spiritual life—a communal space where important decisions were made and rituals performed.</p>

            <h2>Christianity and Change</h2>
            <p>The Bidayuh converted to Christianity more extensively than many Borneo peoples—today over 90% identify as Christian, primarily Roman Catholic and Anglican. Missionary activity from the 19th century onward transformed religious practice and social customs. Traditional beliefs in spirits (antu) coexist with Christianity for many. This religious change affected cultural practices: traditional longhouse living has largely given way to single-family homes, and many ceremonies have been modified or abandoned. The Bidayuh case illustrates how Christianity can become central to indigenous identity while also transforming it.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Bidayuh</h2>
            <p>Modern Bidayuh have integrated into Malaysian society while maintaining ethnic identity. Many have achieved education and professional success in Kuching and beyond. Traditional rice farming continues in rural areas alongside cash crops like pepper. The Bidayuh Cultural Foundation works to preserve language and traditions. Tourism has created interest in traditional culture, leading to reconstructed longhouses and baruk. Multiple Bidayuh dialects create internal diversity; standardization efforts aim to strengthen the language. How the Bidayuh balance Christian identity with indigenous heritage while navigating Malaysian development shapes this Land Dayak people's contemporary life.</p>
