            <h2>Who Are the Noongar?</h2>
            <p>The Noongar (also Nyungar, Nyoongar) are Aboriginal Australian people of the southwestern corner of Western Australia, numbering approximately 30,000-40,000 people claiming Noongar descent. They speak the Noongar language, a dialect chain of the Pama-Nyungan family. Noongar country extends from Geraldton in the north to Esperance in the southeast, encompassing Perth (Boorloo) and surrounding regions. This represents one of Australia's most densely settled Aboriginal territories in the pre-colonial era, supported by the Southwest's relatively abundant resources. The Noongar comprise 14 dialect groups with traditional territories (boodja) within the larger Noongar nation.</p>

            <h2>Six Seasons</h2>
            <p>The Noongar divide the year into six seasons, reflecting environmental changes in the Southwest rather than the European four-season model. These are: Birak (December-January, hot dry season), Bunuru (February-March, hottest time), Djeran (April-May, cooler with morning dew), Makuru (June-July, coldest and wettest), Djilba (August-September, transitional with warming), and Kambarang (October-November, wildflower season). Each season signals different resource availability and appropriate activities. This ecological knowledge guided traditional movement patterns, food gathering, and burning practices. Modern Noongar maintain the six-season calendar, and it has been adopted for land management and environmental education.</p>

            <h2>Native Title Settlement</h2>
            <p>In 2016, the Western Australian Government and six Noongar representative groups signed the South West Native Title Settlement—one of Australia's largest native title agreements. The settlement resolved native title claims over approximately 200,000 square kilometers. While controversial (with some Noongar opposing the surrender of native title rights), the settlement provides funding, land, and recognition. Noongar corporations now manage heritage protection, economic development, and cultural programs. This settlement acknowledged Noongar connection to country while creating mechanisms for involvement in land use decisions. The settlement reflects both achievements and ongoing debates about native title resolution.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Noongar</h2>
            <p>Modern Noongar are the largest Aboriginal group in Western Australia, with a significant population in metropolitan Perth. Many Noongar families trace connections to specific boodja (country) within the larger Noongar nation. Language revitalization efforts work to strengthen Noongar, which suffered decline through colonization. Noongar words have entered Western Australian English. Noongar artists, writers, and performers contribute to Australian culture. Community organizations address health, education, and justice issues. The recognition of traditional ownership in Perth—Australia's fourth-largest city—raises questions about Indigenous presence in urban landscapes. How the Noongar leverage their settlement agreement while addressing ongoing disparities shapes this large Aboriginal nation's future.</p>
