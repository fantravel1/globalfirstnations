            <h2>Who Are the Tiv?</h2>
            <p>The Tiv are a major ethnic group of central Nigeria, primarily inhabiting Benue State and neighboring areas along the Benue River valley. Numbering approximately 6-7 million people, they are Nigeria's fourth largest ethnic group after the Hausa, Yoruba, and Igbo. The Tiv speak Tiv, a Bantoid language of the Niger-Congo family, related to languages of Cameroon from where they migrated centuries ago. Known for their agricultural expertise, distinctive social organization without traditional chiefs, and strong ethnic identity, the Tiv have maintained cultural distinctiveness while participating fully in Nigerian national life. Their egalitarian traditions and farming skills have shaped their historical and contemporary experiences.</p>

            <h2>Egalitarian Society</h2>
            <p>Traditional Tiv society was notably egalitarian, without centralized political authority or hereditary chiefs. Social organization was based on segmentary lineages: groups defined by descent from common ancestors, with no permanent political hierarchy above the compound or extended family level. Elders held influence but not coercive power; decisions emerged through consensus. British colonial administration, requiring chiefs to govern through, had to create artificial chieftaincy positions that lacked traditional legitimacy. This egalitarian tradition made the Tiv resistant to domination and suspicious of concentrated power. The anthropologist Paul Bohannan's detailed studies of Tiv society in the 1950s made them one of the best-documented African peoples in anthropological literature.</p>

            <h2>Farming Excellence</h2>
            <p>The Tiv are renowned as skilled farmers, transforming the Benue valley into one of Nigeria's most productive agricultural regions. Their farming system involves intensive cultivation of yams, cassava, millet, rice, and various vegetables. The compound farm (ato) surrounds each household with carefully managed crops. The Tiv developed sophisticated land-use practices, including fallowing, crop rotation, and integration of livestock. Commercial agriculture has expanded; beniseed (sesame), soybeans, and rice are major cash crops. Agricultural expertise has enabled Tiv expansion into neighboring areas, sometimes generating land conflicts with other groups. Food processing, especially traditional brewing, adds value to harvests.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Tiv</h2>
            <p>Modern Tiv face significant challenges including farmer-herder conflicts, as clashes with Fulani pastoralists over land and resources have caused displacement and deaths in recent years. Political marginalization within Nigeria's ethnic politics creates grievances. Economic development lags despite agricultural productivity. Education has expanded, producing Tiv professionals across Nigerian society. Tiv politicians have served at state and federal levels. Cultural practices including music, dance, and festivals remain vibrant; the Kwagh-Hir puppet theater tradition has gained international recognition. Migration to urban centers creates diaspora communities while rural areas face youth exodus. The Tiv balance strong ethnic identity with Nigerian national integration, navigating contemporary challenges while maintaining cultural distinctiveness.</p>
