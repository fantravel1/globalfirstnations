            <h2>Who Are the Rukai?</h2>
            <p>The Rukai (魯凱族) are an indigenous people of southern Taiwan, numbering approximately 13,000-14,000 people. They speak Rukai, a Formosan language with several dialect groups. The Rukai traditionally inhabited the mountainous region of southern Taiwan, particularly in Pingtung and Kaohsiung counties. Like the Paiwan, Rukai society was hierarchically organized with noble and commoner classes, and chiefs (mamazangiljan) held political and ritual authority. The Rukai are known for their distinctive cultural symbols: the lily flower (salrep), which women of achievement can wear, and the cloud leopard (lrikulraw), which appears in mythology and was reserved for nobility.</p>

            <h2>The Lily Flower</h2>
            <p>The lily flower (salrep, 百合花) holds unique significance in Rukai culture. Women who maintain sexual purity before marriage earn the right to wear lily flowers in their headdresses. For men, the lily represents hunting achievements. This tradition links personal virtue and accomplishment to visible symbols. The lily thus encoded moral values and social recognition. While the specific requirements have moderated with cultural change, the lily remains central to Rukai identity. The annual lily harvest festival (Kalredrepane) celebrates this tradition. The lily symbol appears throughout Rukai cultural representations, from traditional dress to contemporary art.</p>

            <h2>Cloud Leopard Legacy</h2>
            <p>The Formosan cloud leopard (Neofelis nebulosa brachyura), now possibly extinct, held profound significance for the Rukai. Legend describes the cloud leopard as an ancestor or guardian spirit. Only nobles could use cloud leopard pelts in ceremonial dress. Hunters who killed a cloud leopard gained high status, but such kills were rare and surrounded by ritual. The cloud leopard represented power, nobility, and connection to the forest. With the animal's apparent extinction (no confirmed sightings since 1983), the cloud leopard has become a symbol of endangered nature and cultural loss. Conservation efforts and cultural programs invoke the cloud leopard as representing what should be protected.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Rukai</h2>
            <p>Modern Rukai face challenges similar to other Taiwanese indigenous groups: language decline, urbanization, and cultural change. However, strong cultural pride maintains traditions, particularly around the lily symbol and hierarchical social values. Some Rukai villages, particularly Kucapungane (好茶), have achieved recognition for traditional stone architecture and cultural tourism. Natural disasters, including Typhoon Morakot in 2009, have forced village relocations, creating tension between maintaining traditional environments and safety concerns. Rukai artists and musicians have gained prominence. How the Rukai preserve their distinctive traditions—hierarchy, lily symbolism, and cloud leopard memory—while adapting to contemporary Taiwan defines their smaller-numbered but culturally rich community's future.</p>
