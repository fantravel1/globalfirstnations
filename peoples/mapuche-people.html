            <h2>Who Are the Mapuche?</h2>
            <p>The Mapuche ("people of the land") are the largest indigenous group in Chile and Argentina, numbering approximately 1.5-2 million, mostly in Chile. They inhabit their ancestral territory (Wallmapu) spanning south-central Chile and adjacent Argentina, from the Biobío River to Chiloé Island. They speak Mapudungun, a language isolate (or small family). The Mapuche are famous for successfully resisting first Inca and then Spanish conquest for over 350 years—the Arauco War (1536-1883) was one of the longest indigenous resistance struggles in the Americas. Only in the 1880s did Chilean and Argentine military campaigns forcibly incorporate Mapuche territory. Today the Mapuche continue struggling for territorial rights and cultural recognition.</p>

            <h2>Resistance and Independence</h2>
            <p>The Mapuche resisted Inca expansion, limiting the empire's southern boundary. When Spanish conquistadors arrived, the Mapuche initially suffered defeats but adapted quickly—adopting horses, reorganizing military tactics, and producing their own metal weapons. The Arauco War saw generations of conflict. The Spanish never conquered Mapuche territory south of the Biobío River, establishing a frontier recognized by treaties. This de facto independence lasted until the 1880s when Chile's "Pacification of Araucanía" and Argentina's "Conquest of the Desert" campaigns used modern weapons and scorched-earth tactics to subjugate the Mapuche. Legendary leaders include Lautaro, Caupolicán, and Galvarino, celebrated in Alonso de Ercilla's epic poem "La Araucana" (1569-1589).</p>

            <h2>Culture and Spirituality</h2>
            <p>Traditional Mapuche religion centers on maintaining balance between humans, nature, and the spirit world. The machi (shaman, usually female) conducts healing ceremonies using the rewe (carved wooden altar) and kultrun (sacred drum). The nguillatún ceremony brings communities together for collective prayer, offerings, and ritual dancing. Mapuche cosmology includes a complex spirit world with creator deities, ancestral spirits, and nature spirits. Traditional society was organized into rewe (ritual communities) and ayllarehue (larger confederations) without centralized authority until war required unified leadership. Textiles, particularly women's woven ponchos (chamanto) and silver jewelry, demonstrate sophisticated artistic traditions. The Mapuche worldview emphasizes reciprocity with the land, expressed in the concept of küme mongen (good living).</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Mapuche</h2>
            <p>Modern Mapuche face ongoing conflicts over land rights. Much traditional territory was distributed to settlers or sold to forestry companies during the dictatorship. Mapuche communities have engaged in land recuperation movements, sometimes involving occupations and property damage, leading to prosecution under anti-terrorism laws. This conflict has resulted in deaths, imprisonment, and international human rights concerns. Urban Mapuche, particularly in Santiago, work to maintain identity while facing discrimination. The Mapudungun language is endangered, with most speakers over 40. Cultural revitalization includes bilingual education programs, traditional medicine practices, and revival of ceremonial traditions. The Mapuche flag (wenu foye) has become a symbol of indigenous rights protests throughout Chile. Recent constitutional discussions have included Mapuche representatives, though territorial autonomy remains contested.</p>
