            <h2>Who Are the Sorbs?</h2>
            <p>The Sorbs (Serbja/Serby) are a Western Slavic people indigenous to Lusatia, a region in eastern Germany spanning parts of Saxony and Brandenburg. Numbering approximately 50,000-60,000, they are Germany's smallest officially recognized national minority and the remnant of Slavic peoples who once inhabited much of eastern Germany before medieval German expansion. They speak two related but distinct languages: Upper Sorbian (Hornjoserbšćina) around Bautzen/Budyšin in Saxony, and Lower Sorbian (Dolnoserbski) around Cottbus/Chóśebuz in Brandenburg. The Sorbs have maintained Slavic identity surrounded by Germans for over a millennium, making them a remarkable case of cultural survival in a sea of linguistic assimilation.</p>

            </div>

            <h2>Historical Survival</h2>
            <p>The Sorbs are descended from Slavic tribes who settled Lusatia around the 6th century. Medieval German expansion (Ostsiedlung) absorbed most Slavic peoples between the Elbe and Oder rivers, but the Sorbs persisted in the less desirable marshy and forested terrain of Lusatia. They faced assimilation pressure for centuries—Prussian and later German states discouraged Sorbian language and identity. The Nazi regime attempted cultural destruction, banning Sorbian organizations, publications, and public language use. Many Sorbs were conscripted; some leaders were imprisoned. Post-war, East Germany officially protected Sorbian rights—a model minority policy for propaganda purposes, but providing real support for schools, media, and cultural institutions. German reunification raised concerns about continued support, though constitutional protections remain.</p>

            <h2>Culture and Traditions</h2>
            <p>Sorbian culture preserves distinctly Slavic traditions in the heart of Germany. The most famous is Easter egg decoration (pisaći/jejka)—intricately patterned eggs using wax-resist and scratching techniques, internationally recognized as folk art. The Easter riders (Křižerjo) parade on horseback announcing the resurrection in towns around Bautzen. Traditional dress (kroj), particularly women's elaborate costumes with distinctive headdresses, is worn for festivals and church occasions, varying by village. The "birds' wedding" (Ptači kwas) on January 25th is a children's festival with costumes and treats. Sorbian folk music and dance maintain Slavic character. The Domowina (homeland) organization, founded 1912, coordinates cultural preservation. Despite small numbers, Sorbs have produced notable writers, artists, and scholars who documented their heritage.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Sorbs</h2>
            <p>Modern Sorbs face demographic challenges—both languages are endangered, particularly Lower Sorbian with only 7,000-10,000 speakers, most elderly. German is dominant in daily life; young Sorbs increasingly speak German primarily. Coal mining (now phasing out) destroyed some Sorbian villages. The Foundation for the Sorbian People, funded by federal and state governments, supports cultural institutions: the Sorbian Institute research center, Sorbian-language schools (including a bilingual gymnasium), theater, museum, and publishing house. Bilingual signage in Lusatia marks the linguistic border. Sorbian identity has become more assertive—younger Sorbs reclaim heritage that was once embarrassing to admit in German-majority society. The languages' survival depends on continued support for education and whether young families choose to raise children bilingually. The Sorbs demonstrate both the possibility and precariousness of minority survival in modern nation-states.</p>
