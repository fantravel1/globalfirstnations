            <h2>Who Are the Munduruku?</h2>
            <p>The Munduruku (Mundurucú) are an indigenous people of the Tapajós River basin in Pará and Amazonas states, Brazil, numbering approximately 14,000-16,000. They speak Munduruku, a Tupi language of the Munduruku branch. Historically one of Amazonia's most militarily powerful peoples, the Munduruku practiced headhunting and controlled a vast territory. Their name means "red ants" in their language, reflecting their reputation as fierce warriors. Today, the Munduruku are engaged in high-profile resistance to dam construction on the Tapajós River, making them symbols of indigenous environmental activism in Brazil.</p>

            <h2>Warrior Heritage</h2>
            <p>The Munduruku were historically one of Amazonia's most formidable warrior societies. They practiced headhunting, taking and preserving enemies' heads as trophies. Their military organization allowed them to dominate the Tapajós basin, conducting raids against neighboring peoples. When the Portuguese sought to penetrate the Tapajós in the 18th century, they faced fierce Munduruku resistance. Eventually, colonial authorities made peace with the Munduruku, even using them as auxiliary fighters against other indigenous groups. This martial tradition, though headhunting ceased with missionary contact in the 19th century, persists in Munduruku cultural memory and contemporary resistance to outside threats.</p>

            <h2>Dam Resistance</h2>
            <p>Contemporary Munduruku have become internationally known for opposing hydroelectric dam construction on the Tapajós River. The proposed São Luiz do Tapajós and other dams would flood extensive Munduruku territory, destroying villages, sacred sites, and traditional fishing grounds. Munduruku leaders and the Munduruku General Council have organized protests, occupations, and legal challenges. Their resistance gained international attention when they occupied dam construction sites and met with government officials. The dams have been suspended (though not cancelled), partly due to Munduruku activism. This struggle exemplifies indigenous peoples' frontline role in Amazonian environmental defense.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Munduruku</h2>
            <p>Modern Munduruku inhabit multiple indigenous territories in Pará and Amazonas, practicing fishing, agriculture (manioc cultivation), and hunting. Many villages maintain traditional practices including body painting and ceremonial activities. The Munduruku language remains spoken by most community members; bilingual education programs operate in Munduruku schools. Gold mining (garimpo) and illegal logging threaten territories beyond dam projects. The Munduruku face internal debates about development, balancing economic needs with environmental and cultural protection. How this warrior people continues their fight for territorial rights while maintaining cultural identity shapes their ongoing struggle.</p>
