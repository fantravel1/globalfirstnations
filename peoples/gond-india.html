            <h2>Who Are the Gonds?</h2>
            <p>The Gonds are one of India's largest tribal groups, numbering approximately 13 million across Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana. They speak Gondi (a Dravidian language) and regional languages. The Gond once ruled significant kingdoms (16th-18th centuries) in central India before subjugation by Marathas and British. Today, they're best known internationally for Gond art—a distinctive painting tradition that has gained global recognition. The term "Gondwana" (the ancient southern supercontinent) derives from the Gonds, reflecting their perceived antiquity in the region.</p>

            <h2>Gond Kingdoms</h2>
            <p>Unlike many tribal groups, Gonds established significant kingdoms—the Garha-Mandla dynasty (until 1789) and others controlled substantial territories in central India. Gond queens like Durgavati (16th century) became legendary for resisting Mughal expansion. These kingdoms maintained sophisticated administration, built temples, and patronized arts. Maratha expansion and British colonialism destroyed Gond political power; former rulers became subjects, their lands absorbed. This history of state-building distinguishes Gonds from tribes assumed to have always been stateless, challenging colonial narratives about tribal peoples' capabilities.</p>

            <h2>Gond Art</h2>
            <p>Gond painting (Pardhan Gond art) has achieved international recognition. Originally ritual decorations on walls and floors, the tradition was transformed when artist Jangarh Singh Shyam began painting on paper and canvas in the 1980s. The style features intricate patterns filling forms with dots and lines, depicting nature, spirits, and mythology. Bright colors, decorative detail, and magical-realistic imagery distinguish the work. Jangarh's tragic suicide in Japan (2001) highlighted exploitation issues; his family and community continue the tradition. Gond art provides economic opportunity while raising questions about authenticity, commercialization, and indigenous intellectual property.</p>

            <h2>Forest and Displacement</h2>
            <p>Gonds have historically depended on forests—for food, medicine, materials, and spiritual connection. Colonial forest laws restricted traditional access; post-independence "development" displaced thousands for dams, mining, and conservation. The Sardar Sarovar Dam displaced many Gond communities; mining in Chhattisgarh continues causing displacement. The 2006 Forest Rights Act theoretically restored some rights, but implementation remains inadequate. Naxalite (Maoist) insurgency in Gond-inhabited areas reflects poverty and dispossession; Gonds are caught between security forces and rebels. Forest access—for livelihood, culture, and identity—remains central to Gond concerns.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Gond</h2>
            <p>Modern Gonds face severe challenges: poverty, landlessness, health disparities, and inadequate education. Mining and industrialization threaten remaining forest lands. The Naxalite conflict brings violence and militarization. Yet cultural revival persists—Gond art provides income and international recognition; festivals continue; language preservation efforts exist (though Gondi faces pressure from Hindi). How Gonds protect forest rights, maintain cultural identity, achieve economic development, and navigate conflict zones defines their contemporary struggle. The transformation of Gond art from ritual practice to global commodity illustrates both opportunity and tension in indigenous cultural survival.</p>
