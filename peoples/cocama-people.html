            <h2>Who Are the Cocama?</h2>
            <p>The Cocama (Kokama, Cocama-Cocamilla) are an indigenous people living along the Amazon River and its tributaries in Peru, Colombia, and Brazil. Numbering approximately 15,000-25,000, they inhabit the riverine environments of the Peruvian Amazon (particularly Loreto Region), with smaller populations across borders. They speak Cocama, a Tupí-Guaraní language that has become severely endangered despite the population's size. The Cocama were historically major traders on the Amazon, traveling vast distances by canoe. Their name may derive from "koka" (forest) and "ma" (people). Colonial missions and the rubber boom severely disrupted Cocama society, and their contemporary identity has been shaped by centuries of engagement with the colonial and national economy while maintaining distinct cultural traditions.</p>

            <h2>River Life</h2>
            <p>Cocama culture is fundamentally oriented to the river. Traditional economy centered on fishing—using nets, hooks, traps, and arrows—and seasonal flooding agriculture on várzea (floodplain) lands enriched by annual deposits of Andean sediment. The agricultural calendar follows the river's rise and fall: planting when waters recede, harvesting before floods return. Manioc, bananas, corn, and rice are primary crops. Hunting and gathering supplemented riverine resources. Cocama villages are typically built on higher ground along riverbanks, with houses on stilts in flood-prone areas. Navigation skills were legendary—Cocama traders traveled from the Andes foothills to the Amazon's mouth, exchanging salt, cloth, tools, and other goods between highland and lowland peoples. This trading tradition continued into the colonial period.</p>

            <h2>Colonial and Rubber Era</h2>
            <p>Spanish Jesuit missions beginning in the 17th century concentrated previously dispersed Cocama populations, introducing epidemic diseases and Christianity while providing some protection from slave raiders. The missions' expulsion in 1768 dispersed many Cocama. The rubber boom (1870s-1912) brought devastating exploitation—Cocama were forced into debt peonage, collecting rubber under brutal conditions. Many fled to remote areas; others became increasingly integrated into the mestizo population, losing language and visible indigenous identity. This history of exploitation and assimilation led many Cocama to hide indigenous identity for generations. The category "ribereño" (river person) absorbed many Cocama into a generalized peasant identity. Language loss accelerated, with most Cocama communities becoming Spanish-speaking by the mid-20th century.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Cocama</h2>
            <p>Recent decades have seen Cocama cultural revival. Beginning in the 1980s, organizations formed to reclaim Cocama identity and rights. In Peru, the regional federation AIDECOS works on land titling and cultural preservation. People who identified as "ribereños" have reasserted Cocama identity. The Cocama language, now spoken fluently by perhaps only hundreds (mostly elderly), is subject to intensive revitalization efforts, including documentation, teaching materials, and transmission programs. Oil extraction in Cocama territories has caused environmental damage, prompting activism against pollution. Indigenous rights frameworks have provided legal tools for territorial claims. The Cocama story illustrates how indigenous identity can be submerged by colonialism yet reemerge when conditions allow—ethnicity is not fixed but can be reclaimed across generations. Contemporary Cocama balance traditional riverine lifeways with modern economic engagement.</p>
