            <h2>Who Are the Kichwa?</h2>
            <p>The Kichwa (also spelled Quichua in Ecuador) are Ecuador's largest indigenous group, numbering approximately 2.5 million—about 15% of the national population. They speak Kichwa, the Ecuadorian variety of Quechua, the Inca empire's language still spoken by 8-10 million across the Andes. Ecuadorian Kichwa inhabit diverse environments: highland communities in the Andes (Sierra Kichwa) and lowland groups in the Amazon basin (Amazonian Kichwa). Each region has distinct traditions while sharing linguistic and cultural heritage. The Kichwa have been at the forefront of Ecuador's powerful indigenous movement, achieving significant political influence including constitutional recognition of Ecuador as a plurinational state.</p>

            </div>

            <h2>Highland and Lowland</h2>
            <p>Highland Kichwa (Sierra) inhabit Andean valleys and slopes, practicing mixed agriculture—growing potatoes, corn, quinoa, and raising llamas and sheep. They live in rural communities (comunas) with communal land tenure and traditional governance. Famous markets like Otavalo showcase textile traditions. Amazonian Kichwa descended from highland migrants and indigenous lowlanders who adopted Kichwa during missionary and colonial periods. They practice hunting, fishing, and swidden agriculture in the rainforest. Despite different environments and histories, both groups identify as Kichwa, united by language and participation in the indigenous movement. This diversity within unity characterizes Ecuadorian indigenous politics.</p>

            <h2>The Indigenous Movement</h2>
            <p>CONAIE (Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador), founded in 1986, is Latin America's most powerful indigenous organization—and Kichwa form its largest constituency. Through national uprisings (levantamientos), CONAIE has toppled governments, blocked neoliberal policies, and achieved constitutional recognition of collective rights and Ecuador as a "plurinational" state. The 2008 constitution, influenced by indigenous concepts, enshrines Sumak Kawsay (Buen Vivir—Good Living) and rights of nature. Indigenous parties have contested elections; Rafael Correa's government initially allied with indigenous movements before conflict over extractivism. This political power demonstrates what organized indigenous movements can achieve.</p>

            <h2>Sumak Kawsay</h2>
            <p>Sumak Kawsay (Kichwa: "good living" or "living well") is an indigenous philosophy emphasizing harmony between humans, community, and nature—contrasting with Western development focused on endless growth. The concept, elaborated by indigenous intellectuals, entered Ecuador's 2008 constitution as an alternative development paradigm. It emphasizes: living in harmony with Pachamama (Mother Earth), community reciprocity, and sufficiency rather than accumulation. Critics question whether the concept has been co-opted and diluted by state discourse; supporters see it challenging extractivist capitalism. Sumak Kawsay represents Kichwa contribution to global debates about sustainability and alternatives to development.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Kichwa</h2>
            <p>Modern Kichwa face ongoing challenges: extractive industries (oil, mining) threaten territories; economic pressures drive migration to cities; language shift affects youth; climate change disrupts agriculture. Yet cultural revival persists—bilingual education programs, community media, and pride in indigenous identity have strengthened in recent decades. Kichwa communities navigate between maintaining traditions and engaging with global markets (Otavalo traders are famously entrepreneurial). How Kichwa balance economic development with Sumak Kawsay principles, maintain political influence amid Ecuador's volatile politics, and transmit culture to new generations defines their contemporary path.</p>
