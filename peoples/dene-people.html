            <h2>Who Are the Dene?</h2>
            <p>The Dene (meaning "the people") are Athabascan-speaking indigenous peoples of the subarctic regions of Canada, primarily in the Northwest Territories, Yukon, northern British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba. The term encompasses multiple nations including the Chipewyan, Tłı̨chǫ (Dogrib), Yellowknives Dene, Slavey, Sahtu, and others. Together they number over 40,000 people, speaking various related Northern Athabascan languages. The Dene have inhabited the vast boreal forests and tundra transition zones for thousands of years, developing hunting and trapping economies adapted to some of the world's harshest environments. Their lands encompass millions of square kilometers of lakes, rivers, and forests.</p>

            <h2>Subarctic Adaptation</h2>
            <p>Traditional Dene life revolved around seasonal hunting and gathering in the boreal forest and tundra. Caribou were central to survival, providing food, clothing, and shelter materials. Moose, fish, small game, and waterfowl supplemented the diet. Bands moved seasonally following animal migrations and fish runs, living in conical lodges covered with caribou hides. Travel was by birchbark canoe in summer and snowshoe and toboggan in winter, with dog teams becoming important after European contact. The harsh environment required sophisticated knowledge of animal behavior, weather patterns, and survival skills. Social organization was flexible, with small bands coming together or dispersing as resources dictated. Shamans (medicine people) maintained spiritual relationships with animal spirits essential for hunting success.</p>

            <h2>Treaties and Modern Governance</h2>
            <p>Historic treaties (Treaties 8 and 11) signed in the early 20th century established relationships between Dene nations and the Canadian government, though Dene understanding of these treaties often differed from government interpretation. The 1970s saw Dene political mobilization, including the landmark Dene Declaration (1975) asserting nationhood and the right to self-determination. Land claims negotiations have resulted in comprehensive agreements including the Tłı̨chǫ Agreement (2003) and Sahtu Dene and Métis Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement (1993). These modern treaties establish self-government, land ownership, and resource management rights. The Dene have been at the forefront of indigenous rights movements in Canada, articulating visions of self-determination and relationship with the land.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Dene</h2>
            <p>Modern Dene communities face challenges including language loss, with most Dene languages endangered though revitalization programs operate. Resource extraction (mining, oil and gas) on traditional territories creates tensions between economic opportunity and environmental protection. Climate change significantly impacts the boreal environment and traditional practices. Yet Dene cultures remain vital. Many people maintain connections to the land through hunting, trapping, and fishing. Political organizations including the Dene Nation advocate for rights and self-government. Cultural programs preserve languages, stories, and traditional knowledge. Artists like Dene filmmaker Alanis Obomsawin have achieved international recognition. The Dene demonstrate how indigenous peoples can maintain cultural identity while engaging with political and economic systems to protect their lands and rights.</p>
