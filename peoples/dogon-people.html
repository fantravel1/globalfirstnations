            <h2>Who Are the Dogon?</h2>
            <p>The Dogon are an ethnic group inhabiting the Bandiagara Escarpment in Mali, numbering approximately 800,000-900,000 people. They speak Dogon languages, a distinct branch of Niger-Congo with remarkable internal diversity. The Dogon are renowned for their dramatic cliff-side villages, elaborate cosmology, stunning mask traditions, and the Bandiagara cultural landscape, designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Dogon fled to the escarpment centuries ago to escape slave raids and Islamization, developing a spectacular adaptation to vertical cliff environments. Their relative isolation preserved rich religious and artistic traditions that have fascinated anthropologists and tourists alike.</p>

            <h2>Cliff Architecture</h2>
            <p>Dogon villages cling dramatically to the Bandiagara cliff faces and nearby plains, creating one of Africa's most spectacular cultural landscapes. Architecture includes distinctive granaries with conical thatched roofs, the togu na (men's meeting house with low roof forcing seated discussion), and houses built into cliff crevices. The hogon (spiritual leader) lives in special residences. Many villages incorporate caves and overhangs originally inhabited by the Tellem, a mysterious earlier people whose cliff burials the Dogon encountered. Village layout follows cosmological principles. The escarpment setting, though challenging, provided defense against raids and produced a unique built environment now threatened by depopulation.</p>

            <h2>Mask Traditions</h2>
            <p>Dogon masking traditions are among Africa's most elaborate. The Awa society performs the Dama (funeral ceremony) featuring dozens of mask types representing animals, occupational figures, and abstract concepts. The spectacular sirige mask can be 20 feet tall. Masks are carved from wood and painted, with costumes of fiber and cloth. Major ceremonies occur over days, transforming villages into theatrical spaces. The masks escort souls of the deceased to the ancestral realm. The sigui ceremony, occurring every 60 years, involves village-to-village processions with great serpent masks. These performances have attracted tourists, creating tensions between authentic practice and commercial display.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Dogon</h2>
            <p>Modern Dogon face severe challenges. Mali's political instability and especially the rise of jihadist groups in central Mali since 2015 have devastated Dogon communities—massacres, displacement, and conflict with neighboring Fulani have killed thousands. Traditional cliff villages are depopulating as young people seek security and opportunity elsewhere. Climate change reduces agricultural yields. Tourism, once an important income source, has collapsed due to insecurity. Islam has made significant inroads, modifying traditional practices. The Dogon's spectacular heritage—cliff villages, masks, ceremonies—faces an uncertain future amid violence and displacement. International attention has focused on protecting both lives and cultural heritage.</p>
