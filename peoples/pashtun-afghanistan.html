            <h2>Who Are the Pashtun?</h2>
            <p>The Pashtun (Pakhtun, Pathan) are an Eastern Iranian ethnic group of approximately 50-60 million people inhabiting eastern and southern Afghanistan and northwestern Pakistan. They speak Pashto, an Indo-Iranian language with two major dialects. The Pashtun have dominated Afghan politics for over 250 years, founding the modern Afghan state. Their society is organized around a tribal code called Pashtunwali that emphasizes honor, hospitality, and revenge. The Durand Line, drawn by British India in 1893, divided Pashtun lands between Afghanistan and what became Pakistan, a border Afghanistan has never formally recognized.</p>

            <h2>Pashtunwali: The Way of the Pashtun</h2>
            <p>Pashtunwali is an ancient, unwritten code governing Pashtun social behavior. Core principles include melmastia (hospitality, even to enemies), nanawatai (asylum to those who seek it), badal (revenge for wrongs), and nang (honor). A Pashtun must protect guests with his life and avenge insults to family honor. Tribal jirgas (assemblies) resolve disputes according to Pashtunwali. This code has shaped Pashtun resistance to outside powers—Afghans defeated the British Empire twice and resisted Soviet occupation. Yet Pashtunwali's emphasis on honor violence and revenge has also perpetuated conflicts within communities.</p>

            <h2>Tribal Society</h2>
            <p>Pashtun society is segmented into over 400 tribes (qawm) tracing descent from a common ancestor. Major tribal confederations include Durrani, Ghilzai, Karlanri, and Sarbani. Tribes subdivide into clans and families, with identity and loyalty following patrilineal descent. Tribal rivalries have shaped Afghan history—Durrani and Ghilzai competition dominates. Yet in practice, other factors including geography, occupation, and political alignment also determine loyalty. The Taliban movement drew heavily from Pashtun (especially Ghilzai) communities, though ethnic framing oversimplifies complex political dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Poetry and Culture</h2>
            <p>Pashto literature has a rich tradition of poetry, including the works of Khushal Khan Khattak (17th century warrior-poet) and Rahman Baba (Sufi mystic). Landai are short folk poems, traditionally composed by women, expressing love, loss, and social critique—sometimes subversively. Attan is a traditional group dance performed at weddings and celebrations. Music includes the rabab (stringed instrument) and tabla, though Taliban-era prohibitions restricted musical expression. Pashtun culture values oral tradition, with genealogies, proverbs, and stories transmitted through generations.</p>

            <h2>Wars Without End</h2>
            <p>The Pashtun homeland has experienced continuous conflict: Anglo-Afghan Wars, Soviet invasion (1979-1989), civil war, Taliban rule, US-led intervention (2001-2021), and Taliban return. Pashtuns have fought on all sides—as mujahideen, Taliban, government forces, and local militias. Millions became refugees in Pakistan and Iran; many never returned. War has destroyed infrastructure, displaced communities, and militarized society. Yet Pashtun identity has survived—indeed, strengthened through resistance narratives. The future of Pashtun lands remains uncertain as the Taliban controls Afghanistan.</p>
