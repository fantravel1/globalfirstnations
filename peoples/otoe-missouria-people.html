            <h2>Who Are the Otoe-Missouria?</h2>
            <p>The Otoe-Missouria Tribe (federally recognized) has approximately 3,200 enrolled members, headquartered in Red Rock, Oklahoma. The name combines two formerly separate Siouan-speaking nations: the Otoe (from "Wat'ota") and Missouria (from "Niutachi"). They speak Chiwere, a Siouan language also spoken by the Iowa and closely related to Ho-Chunk, now with only a handful of fluent speakers. The Otoe and Missouria originally inhabited the Missouri River region—the Missouria gave their name to both the river and the state. Combined after devastating population losses, the two peoples now form a single nation.</p>

            <h2>Two Nations Merged</h2>
            <p>The Otoe and Missouria were once separate nations speaking closely related Chiwere Siouan languages. The Missouria, occupying the junction of the Missouri and Mississippi rivers, were devastated by wars with neighboring tribes (particularly the Sauk and Fox) and epidemic diseases in the 18th century. Survivors merged with the Otoe, who had themselves separated from the Ho-Chunk and Iowa centuries earlier. By the 19th century, the combined Otoe-Missouria functioned as a single nation. This merger pattern—small populations consolidating for survival—was common across the Plains and Midwest.</p>

            <h2>Removal and Allotment</h2>
            <p>The Otoe-Missouria signed multiple treaties ceding Nebraska and Kansas lands, eventually receiving a reservation in Indian Territory (Oklahoma). Unlike some tribes who resisted allotment, the Otoe-Missouria accepted it relatively early, with land distributed to individual families in the 1880s-90s. This history left the tribe with limited communal land and resources. The 20th century brought challenges common to Oklahoma tribes: economic marginalization, assimilation pressure, and limited federal services. The small population struggled to maintain distinct identity amid these pressures.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Otoe-Missouria</h2>
            <p>Modern Otoe-Missouria have built economic stability through gaming and other enterprises. The tribe operates casinos generating revenue for tribal programs. Language preservation is critical—Chiwere has very few speakers; documentation and teaching efforts work to save what remains. Cultural programs maintain the Otoe-Missouria encampment and other traditions. The tribe has addressed housing, healthcare, and education needs. Environmental programs manage tribal land. How the Otoe-Missouria preserve the heritage of two merged peoples while building modern institutions shapes this combined nation's future in Oklahoma.</p>
