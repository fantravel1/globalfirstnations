            <h2>Who Are the Amazigh?</h2>
            <p>The Amazigh (ⵉⵎⴰⵣⵉⵖⵏ), known externally as Berbers, are the indigenous peoples of North Africa, inhabiting the region from Egypt's Siwa Oasis to Morocco's Atlantic coast, and from the Mediterranean to the Sahara's southern edges. Approximately 30-40 million people speak Amazigh languages, with the largest populations in Morocco (8-12 million) and Algeria (9-10 million). The name "Amazigh" means "free people," contrasting with "Berber," a term derived from the Greek/Roman "barbarian." Despite Arab conquest and Arabization over 1,400 years, Amazigh languages and cultures have persisted.</p>

            <h2>Tifinagh: Ancient Script Revival</h2>
            <p>Tifinagh is an ancient Amazigh script with origins dating back 3,000 years, related to Phoenician writing but developed independently. Preserved among the Tuareg while other Amazigh adopted Arabic script, Tifinagh experienced dramatic revival in the 20th century. Morocco officially adopted a standardized Neo-Tifinagh in 2003, and it now appears on signage, currency, and official documents. This script revival represents broader Amazigh cultural renaissance, reclaiming indigenous identity after centuries of pressure to assimilate to Arab culture.</p>

            <h2>Amazigh Identity Politics</h2>
            <p>For decades, North African governments promoted Arab identity while suppressing Amazigh languages and culture. Algeria banned Tamazight from schools; Morocco prohibited Amazigh names. Beginning in the 1970s, Amazigh movements demanded recognition. The 2011 Arab Spring enabled breakthroughs: Morocco recognized Tamazight as an official language; Algeria followed in 2016. Yet implementation remains incomplete, and activists push for greater rights. The Amazigh movement demonstrates how indigenous peoples within "Arab" nations struggle for recognition and how linguistic rights connect to broader political claims.</p>

            <h2>Regional Diversity</h2>
            <p>The Amazigh encompass distinct groups with varying languages and cultures. The Kabyle of Algeria's mountains are among the most culturally assertive. The Chleuh of Morocco's Atlas and Sous regions maintain distinctive traditions. The Tuareg of the Sahara are famed as desert nomads. The Riffians of northern Morocco have their own identity. The Mozabites of Algeria's M'zab Valley practice Ibadi Islam. This diversity means "Amazigh" is as much umbrella term as unified identity. Different groups face different circumstances and have developed different relationships with national governments.</p>

            <h2>Cultural Traditions</h2>
            <p>Amazigh culture includes distinctive arts, music, and social practices. Geometric designs in carpets, jewelry, and tattoos carry specific meanings. Music ranges from Kabyle protest songs to Gnawa spiritual traditions to Tuareg desert blues. The Amazigh New Year (Yennayer) is increasingly celebrated publicly. Traditional village assemblies (djemaa) practiced forms of democratic governance. Women hold relatively strong positions in some Amazigh societies, controlling property and participating in decision-making. These traditions persist alongside modernization, maintaining identity through adaptation.</p>
