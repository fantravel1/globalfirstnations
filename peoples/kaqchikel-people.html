            <h2>Who Are the Kaqchikel?</h2>
            <p>The Kaqchikel (also Cakchiquel) are a Maya people of the central highlands of Guatemala, concentrated around Lake Atitlán, Chimaltenango, Sacatepéquez, and parts of Guatemala City's surrounding departments. Numbering approximately 800,000-1,000,000, they are one of Guatemala's largest Maya groups. They speak Kaqchikel, a Mayan language closely related to K'iche' and Tz'utujil. The Kaqchikel were one of the major powers of pre-Columbian Guatemala, with their capital at Iximché—a dramatic hilltop city that briefly served as the first Spanish colonial capital before the Kaqchikel rebelled against their erstwhile allies.</p>

            <h2>Iximché and the Conquest</h2>
            <p>Iximché, the Kaqchikel capital founded around 1470, was a fortified hilltop city reflecting the militaristic era following the collapse of earlier Maya unity. The Kaqchikel had split from the K'iche' after a bitter war. When Spanish conquistadors arrived in 1524, Kaqchikel leaders initially allied with them against their K'iche' enemies. Pedro de Alvarado established the first Spanish capital at Iximché. However, Spanish demands for tribute and labor soon led to Kaqchikel rebellion. A brutal four-year war followed; by 1530, Spanish control was established. Iximché was abandoned; the Spanish moved their capital. Today, Iximché is an archaeological park where Maya ceremonies are still performed, symbolizing cultural continuity despite conquest.</p>

            <h2>The Annals of the Kaqchikels</h2>
            <p>The Memorial de Sololá (Annals of the Kaqchikels) is one of the most important indigenous documents from colonial Mesoamerica. Written by Kaqchikel authors using the Latin alphabet after the conquest, it records Kaqchikel history, mythology, and the traumatic events of Spanish colonization from an indigenous perspective. The text describes ancient migrations, the founding of Iximché, wars with the K'iche', the arrival of the Spanish, and the subsequent rebellion. Unlike Spanish accounts that portray conquest as triumph, the Annals document devastation: epidemic diseases, enslavement, torture. This indigenous voice provides invaluable counternarrative to colonial histories.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Kaqchikel</h2>
            <p>Modern Kaqchikel communities span Guatemala's central highlands, from towns around Lake Atitlán to urban areas near Guatemala City. Many Kaqchikel work in agriculture, producing coffee, vegetables, and flowers for domestic and export markets. The proximity to Guatemala City means Kaqchikel communities face intense urbanization pressures, yet maintain distinctive identity through language, dress (women's huipiles feature regional designs), and ceremony. The civil war (1960-1996) devastated some Kaqchikel communities, particularly those suspected of supporting guerrillas. Post-war, cultural revitalization has grown; Maya schools teach in Kaqchikel, and cultural organizations promote heritage. Rigoberta Menchú, Nobel Peace Prize laureate, though K'iche', has supported pan-Maya movements including Kaqchikel causes. The Kaqchikel demonstrate how Maya peoples navigate modernity while maintaining identity rooted in millennium-old traditions.</p>
