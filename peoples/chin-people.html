            <h2>Who Are the Chin?</h2>
            <p>The Chin are a group of related ethnicities inhabiting Chin State in western Myanmar and the Mizoram and Manipur states of India (where they are called Mizo, Kuki, Zomi). Total population is approximately 1.5-2 million. "Chin" encompasses numerous subgroups speaking over 50 related Tibeto-Burman languages (Kuki-Chin branch), often mutually unintelligible. They inhabit the rugged mountains along the Myanmar-India border, historically isolated from lowland states. The Chin are known for women's facial tattoos (now rare, found only among elderly women), traditional weaving, and massive conversion to Christianity in the 20th century. Chin State is Myanmar's poorest region, and many Chin have migrated abroad, creating significant diaspora communities.</p>

            <h2>Facial Tattoos</h2>
            <p>The most distinctive Chin tradition—now found only among elderly women—is facial tattooing. Girls were tattooed between ages 9-14, with patterns varying by village and subgroup. The process was painful, using thorns or needles and plant-based dyes, and took several days. Various explanations exist: making women unattractive to Burmese kings who might take them as concubines, marking clan identity, or enhancing beauty according to Chin standards. The practice was banned by British colonial authorities and missionaries, ending by the mid-20th century. Today, the few remaining tattooed women (born before approximately 1940) are sometimes visited by tourists, raising questions about exploitation. Photographers and documentary filmmakers have sought these women, providing income but sometimes treating them as curiosities rather than people.</p>

            <h2>Christianity and Change</h2>
            <p>Christian missionaries, particularly American Baptists, transformed Chin society. Beginning in the late 19th century, missionaries converted large numbers, and today over 90% of Chin identify as Christian—one of Asia's highest rates. Traditional practices—ancestor worship, animal sacrifice, spirit propitiation—were largely abandoned. Missionaries introduced literacy, creating written forms for Chin languages; schools and hospitals followed. Christianity became central to Chin identity, distinguishing them from Buddhist Burmese. Chin churches developed strong organizational structures that provided community leadership beyond religion. However, conversion also meant loss of traditional knowledge, ceremonies, and cultural practices. Contemporary Chin navigate between Christian identity and efforts to preserve pre-Christian cultural heritage—traditional dress, dances, and crafts continue, often in church-sponsored contexts.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Chin</h2>
            <p>Modern Chin face severe challenges. Chin State is Myanmar's poorest and least developed region—mountainous terrain, limited infrastructure, and government neglect mean high poverty rates. Many Chin migrate internally to cities or abroad for economic opportunities. Significant Chin diaspora communities exist in Malaysia (though often without legal status and vulnerable to exploitation), India, the US, Australia, and elsewhere. The 2021 military coup affected Chin State severely, with resistance to the junta emerging quickly; the town of Thantlang was largely destroyed by military attacks. Chin political organizations advocate for federal autonomy. Despite dispersal, Chin maintain strong ethnic identity through churches, language, and cultural associations. Chin National Day (February 20) is celebrated worldwide. The diverse Chin subgroups increasingly identify as a unified people, though linguistic fragmentation remains—communication between subgroups often requires Burmese or English.</p>
