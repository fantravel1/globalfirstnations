            <h2>Who Are the Marind-anim?</h2>
            <p>The Marind-anim are a Papuan people of the southern coastal lowlands spanning the Indonesia-Papua New Guinea border, primarily in Indonesia's Papua Province (formerly Irian Jaya) around Merauke, with some communities across the border in PNG's Western Province. Numbering approximately 8,000-12,000, they speak Marind, a Marind family language. The Marind-anim were historically one of New Guinea's most feared headhunting peoples, conducting raids across vast distances. Dutch colonial suppression ended headhunting but devastated their population and culture. Today they face new pressures from massive rice and palm oil plantations that have seized their lands.</p>

            <h2>Headhunting Culture</h2>
            <p>Traditional Marind-anim society was organized around headhunting. Raids traveled hundreds of kilometers to take heads from enemy groups, including peoples as far as the Asmat coast and Torres Strait islands. Heads were essential for naming children—each child required a head from which their name was taken. Heads were also needed for major ceremonies, house-building, and male initiation. This created cycles of raiding and retaliation across the region. Dutch colonial forces suppressed headhunting beginning in the early 20th century, imposing severe punishments and disrupting the ceremonial complex that required heads. Population collapsed due to introduced diseases and the disruption of social structures; the Marind-anim nearly became extinct before stabilizing at greatly reduced numbers.</p>

            <h2>Land Grabbing</h2>
            <p>Contemporary Marind-anim face massive land appropriation. The Indonesian government's Merauke Integrated Food and Energy Estate (MIFEE) project, launched in 2010, designated 1.2 million hectares—much of it Marind-anim ancestral land—for industrial agriculture, primarily rice and palm oil. Companies have cleared forests, drained wetlands, and disrupted sago palm resources essential to Marind-anim subsistence. Community consent has been inadequate or coerced; promised benefits have not materialized. Indigenous organizations and international advocates have documented human rights violations and environmental destruction. The Marind-anim case represents how colonial-era land seizure continues under development projects that appropriate indigenous territories for national and corporate interests.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Marind-anim</h2>
            <p>Modern Marind-anim communities struggle with the double legacy of colonial destruction and contemporary land grabbing. Traditional sago-based subsistence has been undermined by land loss; many Marind-anim depend increasingly on cash economy they are poorly positioned to enter. Christianity (Catholic) became widespread after pacification; traditional ceremonies have declined but cultural knowledge persists among elders. Youth face limited opportunities; traditional skills become less relevant as forests disappear. Advocacy organizations fight for land rights, but Indonesian courts and government have largely favored development interests. The Marind-anim demonstrate how indigenous peoples whose cultures were disrupted by colonialism face renewed dispossession from contemporary development, with limited power to resist either historical or ongoing appropriation.</p>
