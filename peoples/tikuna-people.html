            <h2>Who Are the Tikuna?</h2>
            <p>The Tikuna (also Ticuna or Magüta) are the largest indigenous people of the Brazilian Amazon, numbering approximately 50,000-60,000, with additional populations in Colombia (approximately 10,000) and Peru (approximately 6,000). They inhabit the region where Brazil, Colombia, and Peru meet along the upper Amazon/Solimões River. They speak Tikuna, a language isolate with no known relatives. The Tikuna are known for their elaborate puberty rituals, bark cloth painting, and complex mythology. Their large population and relative cultural vitality make them one of the most significant indigenous groups in Amazonia.</p>

            <h2>The Worecü Ceremony</h2>
            <p>The Worecü (or Festa da Moça Nova) is the Tikuna girls' puberty ceremony, one of Amazonia's most elaborate ritual cycles. When a girl experiences her first menstruation, she enters seclusion, during which she learns skills and cultural knowledge. The ceremony concludes with a festival lasting several days, featuring masked dancers representing mythological beings, ritual songs, and the girl's symbolic "rebirth" as a woman. She is painted with genipap and adorned with elaborate regalia. The ceremony reinforces clan identity (Tikuna society is organized into patrilineal clans), transmits mythology, and marks social transition. Though modified by contact and conversion, the worecü continues in many Tikuna communities.</p>

            <h2>Bark Cloth Art</h2>
            <p>The Tikuna are renowned for their bark cloth (tururi) painting, producing some of Amazonia's most distinctive indigenous art. Bark is pounded and stretched to create a canvas on which artists paint mythological scenes, animals, and geometric designs using natural pigments. These paintings illustrate Tikuna cosmology—the origin of clans, culture heroes, and spiritual beings. Originally created for ritual contexts, bark cloth art is now also produced for sale, providing income while transmitting cultural knowledge. Tikuna artists have gained recognition in Brazilian and international art markets, and their work is collected by museums worldwide.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Tikuna</h2>
            <p>Modern Tikuna face challenges of maintaining cultural identity across three national borders. In Brazil, they have achieved demarcation of multiple indigenous territories, though land conflicts continue. Evangelical Christianity has spread widely, sometimes conflicting with traditional practices. Economic livelihoods include fishing, agriculture, and increasingly, handicraft sales and tourism. The Tikuna language remains vital, spoken by the majority, and bilingual education programs exist. Cross-border family connections persist despite national boundaries. How the Tikuna maintain cultural cohesion across their transnational territory while adapting to integration with three different national societies shapes this populous Amazonian people's future.</p>
