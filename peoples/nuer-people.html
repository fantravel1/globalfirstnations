            <h2>Who Are the Nuer?</h2>
            <p>The Nuer (Naath—"human beings") are a Nilotic people of South Sudan and western Ethiopia, numbering approximately 2-3 million. They speak Nuer, a Western Nilotic language closely related to Dinka. The Nuer inhabit the swampy, seasonally flooded plains around the junction of the Nile and its tributaries. They became famous through the classic anthropological works of E.E. Evans-Pritchard, whose studies in the 1930s described their segmentary lineage system, "ordered anarchy" without centralized authority, and cattle-centered culture. The Nuer have experienced decades of devastating civil war, first as part of Sudanese conflicts, then in South Sudan's 2013-2018 civil war, in which Nuer and Dinka political leaders became adversaries. The Nuer demonstrate both remarkable social organization without state structures and the tragedy of modern ethnic violence.</p>

            <h2>Cattle Culture</h2>
            <p>Nuer life revolves around cattle. The Nuer are transhumant pastoralists, moving cattle between wet-season highland villages and dry-season camps along rivers. Cattle provide milk (the dietary staple), blood (drunk fresh from the living animal), and occasionally meat. But cattle's significance transcends nutrition—they are wealth, social currency, and spiritual beings. Marriages require cattle bride-wealth payments; disputes are settled through cattle compensation; sacrifices to spirits involve cattle. Men take "cattle names" from favorite animals; poetry and songs celebrate cattle beauty. Individual cattle are named, their colors described with elaborate vocabulary, their lineages remembered. This devotion to cattle shapes settlement patterns, seasonal movements, social relationships, and religious practice. The Nuer cannot be understood without understanding their cattle.</p>

            <h2>Segmentary Society</h2>
            <p>Evans-Pritchard's analysis of Nuer "segmentary opposition" became a foundational anthropological concept. Nuer society is organized into nested segments—from minimal lineages to major clans and tribal sections—that unite or divide depending on context. As the saying goes: "I against my brother; my brother and I against my cousin; my cousin, my brother, and I against the world." This system allows coordination without centralized authority. Feuds between lineages are regulated by "leopard-skin chiefs" (earth priests) who mediate but cannot enforce. What appears as "anarchy" is actually highly ordered, with kinship providing structure for cooperation and conflict. This decentralized political system proved remarkably resilient—the British failed to establish effective colonial control—but also has been exploited by modern politicians mobilizing ethnic identity for power.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Nuer</h2>
            <p>Modern Nuer have endured decades of war and displacement. The second Sudanese civil war (1983-2005) devastated Nuer regions; the Bor massacre (1991), in which a Nuer faction killed thousands of Dinka civilians, presaged later ethnic violence. South Sudan's independence (2011) brought hope, but civil war erupted in 2013 when President Kiir (Dinka) and Vice President Machar (Nuer) became enemies. The resulting conflict killed hundreds of thousands and displaced millions, with both sides committing ethnic massacres. Nuer areas were particularly affected. Many Nuer fled to refugee camps in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Uganda, or resettled abroad (including substantial diaspora communities in the US). The 2018 peace agreement has reduced but not ended violence. Traditional cattle culture persists where possible, but displacement, urbanization, and education are transforming Nuer society. The Nuer story illustrates how ethnic identities, partly constructed by colonialism and anthropology, can become deadly when mobilized for political conflict.</p>
