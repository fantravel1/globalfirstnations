            <h2>Who Are the Deori?</h2>
            <p>The Deori are a Tibeto-Burman indigenous people of Assam, India, numbering approximately 60,000-70,000 people. They speak Deori (Jimochaya), a Tibeto-Burman language of the Bodo-Garo group. The name "Deori" comes from "Deva" (god) and denotes their historical role as priests in the Ahom kingdom's temples. The Deori were hereditary temple priests who maintained Ahom religious practices for centuries. They primarily inhabit parts of Lakhimpur, Dhemaji, and Tinsukia districts in upper Assam, along the Brahmaputra and its tributaries. The Deori are known for their Bohagiyo Bishu festival and distinct cultural traditions that blend their own practices with those inherited from Ahom service.</p>

            <h2>Ahom Priestly Heritage</h2>
            <p>The Deori served as hereditary priests (Deori literally means "one who serves the gods") in the Ahom kingdom, which ruled Assam for six centuries. They maintained temples, performed rituals, and preserved religious traditions of the Ahom ruling class. This priestly function gave them a unique status within Assamese society. After the Ahom kingdom ended with British colonization, the Deori retained their identity and religious knowledge. Some continue temple duties at historic Ahom sites. This heritage distinguishes the Deori from neighboring tribes and connects them to Assam's medieval history, though their original Tibeto-Burman culture predates their Ahom religious role.</p>

            <h2>Bohagiyo Bishu Festival</h2>
            <p>Bohagiyo Bishu is the main Deori festival, celebrated in mid-April to mark the Assamese New Year and agricultural cycle. The festival spans several days with rituals, community gatherings, traditional sports, and cultural performances. Key activities include worship of Kundi-Mama (ancestral deities), communal feasting, and traditional Deori dances. The festival brings scattered Deori communities together, reinforces identity, and transmits cultural knowledge to younger generations. While sharing timing with the broader Assamese Bihu celebrations, Bohagiyo Bishu maintains distinctly Deori rituals and traditions, marking it as a unique expression of Deori cultural identity.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Deori</h2>
            <p>Modern Deori have Scheduled Tribe status in India. The Deori language is classified as endangered, with fewer fluent speakers among youth as Assamese dominates education and daily life. Cultural organizations work to document and revitalize the language. Traditional practices continue, though modified by Hindu influences and modernization. Economic challenges include limited development in remote Deori areas and dependence on agriculture. Some Deori have entered professional fields through education. The community navigates between preserving their unique priestly heritage and Tibeto-Burman identity while integrating into broader Assamese society. Language revitalization and cultural documentation are priorities for Deori organizations.</p>
