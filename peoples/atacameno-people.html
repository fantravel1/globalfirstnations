            <h2>Who Are the Atacameño?</h2>
            <p>The Atacameño, who call themselves Lickanantay ("people of this land"), are the indigenous people of the Atacama Desert in northern Chile—the driest non-polar desert on Earth. Numbering approximately 21,000-30,000, they inhabit oasis communities in the Salar de Atacama basin and surrounding highlands, including the famous town of San Pedro de Atacama. The traditional Kunza language is extinct; the last speakers died in the 20th century, though revival efforts continue. The Atacameño developed remarkable adaptations to desert life over millennia, including sophisticated irrigation systems, llama caravans for long-distance trade, and a culture deeply connected to the stark landscape of salt flats, volcanoes, and high-altitude steppes.</p>

            <h2>Desert Civilization</h2>
            <p>The Atacameño created a flourishing civilization in one of Earth's most hostile environments. Where underground rivers surfaced at oases, they developed intricate irrigation systems (acequias) that transformed desert into agricultural land. Crops included maize, quinoa, beans, squash, and chili peppers. Llama herding provided meat, wool, and transport animals for trade caravans crossing the Andes to exchange coastal products (fish, shells) for highland and Amazonian goods. The Atacameño were middlemen in vast trade networks connecting the Pacific coast to the Amazon. Skilled metallurgists worked copper and gold; distinctive ceramic styles marked Atacameño cultural identity. Stone fortresses (pukaras) defended against raiders. This desert civilization reached its height before Inca conquest in the 15th century.</p>

            <h2>Sacred Landscape</h2>
            <p>Atacameño spirituality centers on the dramatic landscape: snow-capped volcanoes, salt flats, and the Milky Way visible with extraordinary clarity in the dry atmosphere. Mountains (mallku) were considered sacred beings requiring offerings and respect. Rituals marked agricultural cycles, sought rain (precious in the desert), and honored ancestors. Llamas were sacrificed during important ceremonies. The corpse mummies found in Atacama caves demonstrate elaborate mortuary practices; the dry climate naturally preserved bodies for millennia. Some Atacama mummies predate Egyptian mummification. Contemporary Atacameño maintain ceremonial traditions, including offerings to mountains and celebrations of agricultural festivals. The landscape remains central to cultural identity, leading to conflicts over mining and astronomical observatory development on sacred peaks.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Atacameño</h2>
            <p>Modern Atacameño face complex challenges. The Atacama contains some of Earth's richest mineral deposits—copper, lithium, and others critical to global industry. Mining operations compete for scarce water resources and damage sacred sites. Lithium extraction from the Salar de Atacama particularly threatens water supplies and flamingo habitat. Tourism, centered on San Pedro de Atacama's dramatic landscapes, provides economic opportunities but raises concerns about cultural commodification. Atacameño communities have organized to negotiate with mining companies, defend water rights, and control tourism on their lands. The Kunza language revitalization effort faces the challenge of having no living speakers but draws on historical documentation. The Atacameño demonstrate how indigenous peoples navigate between cultural preservation, environmental protection, and economic development in resource-rich regions.</p>
