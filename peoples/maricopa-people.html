            <h2>Who Are the Maricopa?</h2>
            <p>The Maricopa (Piipaash, meaning "people") are a River Yuman-speaking indigenous people of central Arizona, who migrated from the lower Colorado River to the middle Gila River in historic times. They speak Maricopa, a River Yuman language closely related to Quechan and Mohave. Originally inhabiting the Colorado River valley, the Maricopa moved eastward due to warfare with the Quechan and other groups, eventually settling along the Gila River among the friendly Akimel O'odham (Pima). Before contact, they numbered perhaps 2,000-3,000 people. Today, the Maricopa share the Gila River Indian Community and Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community with Akimel O'odham, with perhaps 800-1,000 Maricopa enrolled members.</p>

            <h2>River Migration</h2>
            <p>The Maricopa's history includes a dramatic migration from the Colorado River to the Gila River, likely occurring gradually between the 1600s and 1800s due to intensifying warfare with the Quechan, Mohave, and Yavapai. Moving up the Gila River, they found refuge among the Akimel O'odham (Pima), who welcomed them as allies against Apache raiders. The two peoples developed close relationships while maintaining distinct identities, languages, and cultural practices. The Maricopa brought river Yuman traditions—including pottery styles, cremation practices, and warfare techniques—to their new homeland. Their Yuman language and customs contrasted with O'odham Uto-Aztecan culture, but cooperation proved beneficial for both groups.</p>

            <h2>Pottery Tradition</h2>
            <p>Maricopa pottery became famous for its distinctive quality and aesthetic. Using paddle-and-anvil techniques and red-on-buff decorative styles, Maricopa women created pottery that was both functional and beautiful. In the early 20th century, potters like Ida Redbird and later artists developed the Maricopa style for commercial markets, creating award-winning pieces. The pottery tradition uses local clays and traditional firing techniques. Contemporary Maricopa potters continue the tradition, producing work collected by museums and individuals. This pottery heritage distinguishes Maricopa cultural contribution even as the community shares reservations and governance with the larger O'odham population.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Maricopa</h2>
            <p>Modern Maricopa people are members of two communities: the Gila River Indian Community (larger, south of Phoenix) and the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community (smaller, east of Scottsdale). Both tribes have developed substantial economic enterprises, including casinos, resorts, and other businesses. The Maricopa maintain distinct identity within shared tribal governments, preserving language (severely endangered with perhaps 100 speakers), pottery traditions, and cultural knowledge. The Gila River Indian Community operates Wild Horse Pass Casino and other enterprises; Salt River operates Casino Arizona and Talking Stick Resort. Though small in numbers, the Maricopa continue cultural practices and maintain their identity as a distinct people within the broader community context.</p>
