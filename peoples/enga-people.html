            <h2>Who Are the Enga?</h2>
            <p>The Enga are the largest ethnolinguistic group in Papua New Guinea, numbering approximately 400,000-500,000 people. They inhabit Enga Province in the central highlands, one of the most densely populated regions of the New Guinea highlands. They speak Enga, a Trans-New Guinea language with several dialects. The Enga are renowned for their elaborate ceremonial exchange system (tee), spectacular body decoration for festivals, and unfortunately in recent decades, for intense tribal warfare that has escalated with the introduction of modern weapons. Their territory includes the massive Porgera gold mine, which has brought wealth, conflict, and environmental devastation.</p>

            <h2>Tee Exchange System</h2>
            <p>The tee is a complex ceremonial exchange system that historically structured Enga social and political life. Networks of exchange partners passed pigs, shells, and other valuables along chains spanning the province. Big men (kamongo) built reputations through their ability to give generously while maintaining exchange obligations. The tee created alliances across clan boundaries, moderated conflicts, and distributed resources. Major tee festivals featured hundreds of decorated participants, thousands of pigs, and weeks of ceremony. Colonial disruption and modern economics have transformed the tee, but ceremonial exchange remains important in Enga social life, now incorporating cash and manufactured goods alongside traditional valuables.</p>

            <h2>Tribal Warfare</h2>
            <p>Tribal warfare has been endemic in Enga society, but escalated dramatically since the 1990s with the introduction of high-powered firearms. Traditional conflicts over land, pigs, and honor were fought with bows and arrows; deaths were limited. Modern tribal fights involve automatic weapons, cause dozens or hundreds of deaths, displace thousands, and destroy infrastructure. The Porgera gold mine has intensified conflicts—disputes over compensation, benefits distribution, and mine-related grievances fuel violence. The PNG government has struggled to control the fighting; states of emergency have been declared repeatedly. This warfare has made Enga Province one of Papua New Guinea's most dangerous regions, undermining development and perpetuating cycles of violence and revenge.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Enga</h2>
            <p>Modern Enga society presents stark contrasts. The Porgera mine (one of the world's largest gold mines until its recent closure/renegotiation) generated enormous wealth—some Enga have become millionaires—while others remain in subsistence agriculture. Cash has transformed exchange systems and social relations. Christianity (primarily Lutheran and Catholic) has become widespread. Education has expanded; Enga professionals work throughout PNG. Yet tribal warfare, land disputes, and governance challenges persist. Women face particular difficulties; domestic violence rates are high, and women have been victims of horrific violence during tribal conflicts. The Enga demonstrate both the transformative potential and devastating consequences of extractive industry in indigenous highlands societies.</p>
