            <h2>Who Are the Cocopah?</h2>
            <p>The Cocopah (also Cucapá, meaning "river people" or "people of the river") are a Delta Yuman-speaking indigenous people of the Colorado River delta, traditionally inhabiting the area where the river meets the Gulf of California in present-day southwestern Arizona and northwestern Baja California, Mexico. They speak Cocopah, a Yuman language related to Mohave and Quechan. Before contact, the Cocopah numbered perhaps 3,000-4,000 people. Their homeland included the rich wetlands of the delta, which provided abundant fish, waterfowl, and agricultural land. Today, the Cocopah Tribe of Arizona has approximately 1,000 enrolled members, while related communities in Mexico face different circumstances under Mexican indigenous policies.</p>

            <h2>Delta Environment</h2>
            <p>Traditional Cocopah territory centered on the Colorado River delta, one of North America's most productive ecosystems before modern dam construction eliminated its flow. The delta's marshes, sloughs, and lagoons supported abundant fish, waterfowl, and wildlife. The Cocopah practiced floodplain agriculture like other river peoples, planting crops in the rich silt deposited by annual floods. Unlike upstream groups, they also exploited marine and estuarine resources from the Gulf of California, including fish, shellfish, and sea mammals. This delta abundance supported permanent villages and relatively dense populations. The delta was a dynamic environment, with the river shifting course; the Cocopah adapted to these changes through mobility and environmental knowledge.</p>

            <h2>Delta Destruction</h2>
            <p>The Colorado River delta has been devastated by upstream water diversion. Hoover Dam (1935) and subsequent dams captured virtually the entire river flow for urban and agricultural use; the Colorado now rarely reaches the sea. The once-lush delta has become largely desert, with dry channels and dead trees. This ecological collapse destroyed the Cocopah's traditional subsistence base. Additionally, the international border separated U.S. and Mexican Cocopah communities, complicating family connections and creating different political contexts for each group. Mexican Cocopah in Baja California face ongoing land conflicts with agricultural interests. The Cocopah case demonstrates how water diversion can utterly transform indigenous homelands, eliminating the ecological basis of traditional life.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Cocopah</h2>
            <p>Modern Cocopah in Arizona live on a reservation near Somerton. The tribe operates the Cocopah Casino and Resort and has developed other enterprises. Agricultural land is leased to non-Indian farmers. Cultural revitalization includes language preservation—Cocopah is critically endangered—and documentation of traditional knowledge. Cross-border connections with Mexican Cocopah continue despite border complications. Mexican Cocopah communities struggle with land tenure and economic marginalization; fishing in the remnant delta provides some subsistence. International advocacy has highlighted the delta's destruction and called for restoration flows. Some water releases in recent years have briefly revived portions of the delta, offering hope that partial restoration might be possible. The Cocopah persist at both ends of a destroyed ecosystem, maintaining identity despite the loss of the river that defined their culture.</p>
