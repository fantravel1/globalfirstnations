            <h2>Who Are the Irish?</h2>
            <p>The Irish (Muintir na hÉireann) are a Celtic people indigenous to Ireland, an island in the North Atlantic comprising the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland (part of the United Kingdom). The population of the island is approximately 7 million; the global Irish diaspora numbers over 70 million, making the Irish one of the most dispersed peoples in the world. They speak Irish (Gaeilge), a Goidelic Celtic language, though English has been dominant since the 19th century. Irish civilization has ancient roots—Neolithic monuments like Newgrange predate the pyramids. The Irish developed a distinctive Celtic Christian culture that preserved classical learning during the early medieval period, when Irish monks spread education across Europe, earning Ireland the epithet "island of saints and scholars."</p>

            <h2>Colonial History</h2>
            <p>Ireland experienced centuries of English/British colonization beginning with the Norman invasion (1169). Subsequent centuries saw land confiscation, plantation of English and Scottish settlers, suppression of Catholicism and Irish culture, and repeated failed rebellions. The Penal Laws (17th-18th centuries) stripped Catholics of rights. The Great Famine (1845-1852), caused by potato blight but exacerbated by British policy, killed approximately one million and drove another million to emigrate, beginning mass diaspora. Ireland's population fell from over 8 million to about 4 million and has never recovered. Independence was partially achieved in 1922, though Northern Ireland remained under British rule, leading to decades of conflict (the Troubles, 1968-1998). This colonial history—dispossession, famine, emigration, and resistance—fundamentally shapes Irish identity.</p>

            <h2>Language and Culture</h2>
            <p>Irish (Gaeilge) was once spoken across Ireland but declined dramatically under colonization, especially after the Famine (Irish speakers were disproportionately poor and died or emigrated). Today about 1.7 million claim some Irish ability, but only 70,000-80,000 use it daily, mostly in Gaeltacht (Irish-speaking) regions along the western coast. Irish is a compulsory school subject in the Republic, generating mixed feelings—some see it as heritage, others as burden. Irish culture transcends language: traditional music (fiddle, tin whistle, uilleann pipes, bodhrán), sean-nós singing, Irish dance, storytelling, and literature. Irish writers have produced four Nobel laureates (Yeats, Shaw, Beckett, Heaney). The pub as social institution, GAA sports (hurling, Gaelic football), and Catholicism (though declining) shape Irish life.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Irish</h2>
            <p>Modern Ireland has transformed dramatically. The Republic, once poor and agricultural, became the "Celtic Tiger" (1990s-2008), attracted by EU membership and multinational investment—a transformation interrupted by the 2008 financial crisis but now recovered. Social change has been rapid: divorce legalized (1995), same-sex marriage approved by referendum (2015), and abortion decriminalized (2018) in a once staunchly Catholic country. Northern Ireland achieved peace with the Good Friday Agreement (1998), though Brexit has complicated the situation. The global Irish diaspora maintains connections—St. Patrick's Day is celebrated worldwide. Return migration and immigration have made Ireland more diverse. Irish identity remains strong both at home and abroad, characterized by literature, music, humor, and memory of historical struggle. The question of Irish reunification remains open, potentially reshaped by Brexit and demographic change.</p>
