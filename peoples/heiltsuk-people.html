            <h2>Who Are the Heiltsuk?</h2>
            <p>The Heiltsuk (historically called Bella Bella by Europeans) are a First Nations people of the central coast of British Columbia, Canada. Numbering approximately 2,500-3,000, with about half living in their main community of Bella Bella (Waglisla), they speak Hailhzaqvla (Heiltsuk), a Wakashan language related to Kwakwaka'wakw. The Heiltsuk have occupied their territory for at least 14,000 years—archaeological evidence from their lands represents some of the oldest human settlement on the Northwest Coast. Their territory encompasses a vast network of islands, inlets, and coastal forests, traditionally managed through a sophisticated system of stewardship that modern conservation science is now learning from.</p>

            <h2>Ancient Settlement</h2>
            <p>Archaeological discoveries in Heiltsuk territory have rewritten understanding of early human settlement in the Americas. Excavations at Triquet Island revealed a village site continuously occupied for 14,000 years—older than the Egyptian pyramids and one of the oldest settlements in North America. These finds support oral traditions describing continuous Heiltsuk presence since time immemorial. The central coast's relatively mild climate and abundant marine resources supported settlement even during glacial periods, making it a potential refuge and migration corridor for early peoples. The Heiltsuk oral histories, once dismissed by scientists, have proven remarkably accurate, demonstrating the value of Indigenous knowledge.</p>

            <h2>Environmental Stewardship</h2>
            <p>The Heiltsuk developed sophisticated resource management practices over millennia. Clam gardens—rock-walled terraces that enhanced shellfish productivity—are now recognized as ingenious mariculture. Forest management through controlled burning maintained productive habitats. Fishing practices ensured salmon sustainability. Traditional laws regulated resource use, with territories assigned to families and access governed by protocols. Modern Heiltsuk have become leaders in marine conservation, establishing the Indigenous-led Heiltsuk Integrated Resource Management Department. They played key roles in creating the Great Bear Rainforest agreements protecting their territory. Their traditional knowledge increasingly informs scientific research and conservation policy.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Heiltsuk</h2>
            <p>Modern Heiltsuk center on Bella Bella, a remote community accessible only by sea or air. Fishing remains economically and culturally important. The 2016 Nathan E. Stewart diesel spill in Heiltsuk waters brought national attention to the risks of coastal shipping; Heiltsuk-led response demonstrated both community resilience and the inadequacy of governmental emergency systems. Language revitalization programs address severe decline—fewer than 100 fluent speakers remain. Cultural revival includes potlatch ceremonies, carving, and traditional practices. The Heiltsuk pursue treaty negotiations while asserting inherent rights. Tourism, including eco-tourism and cultural experiences, provides economic opportunity. The Heiltsuk demonstrate how Indigenous peoples can lead in environmental protection while rebuilding cultures damaged by colonialism.</p>
