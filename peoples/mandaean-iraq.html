            <h2>Who Are the Mandaeans?</h2>
            <p>The Mandaeans (Mandaʾaya, "Gnostics") are an ethno-religious community indigenous to southern Iraq and southwestern Iran, practicing the only surviving Gnostic religion. Numbering perhaps 60,000-100,000 worldwide (most now in diaspora), Mandaeans follow teachings they attribute to John the Baptist and practice frequent ritual baptism in flowing water. Their religion combines Gnostic cosmology, reverence for water, and distinctive rituals conducted by priests. The 2003 Iraq War devastated the community, with perhaps 90% of Iraqi Mandaeans fleeing persecution to become refugees in Jordan, Syria, and eventually Western countries.</p>

            <h2>Gnostic Beliefs</h2>
            <p>Mandaeism is the only surviving Gnostic religion—traditions that emphasize secret knowledge (gnosis) for salvation and typically view the material world as flawed or evil. Mandaeans believe in a supreme God of light and elaborate cosmologies of celestial beings. Souls descend from the World of Light and must return through proper ritual and ethical life. Unlike Christian Gnosticism, Mandaeism developed independently in Mesopotamia. They revere John the Baptist but reject Jesus, Moses, and Muhammad as false prophets. The religious worldview is complex and largely unknown outside scholarly circles.</p>

            <h2>The Living Water</h2>
            <p>Water is central to Mandaean practice, which requires access to flowing ("living") water for baptism (masbuta) and other rituals. Priests (tarmida) conduct baptisms regularly—not once but frequently throughout life. The Mandaean diaspora faces challenges finding suitable water sources in urban Western environments; some communities have constructed flowing water channels. Rivers like the Tigris and Euphrates were traditionally essential to Mandaean life. Climate change and damming of Mesopotamian rivers threaten remaining communities in Iraq, who struggle to perform rituals in diminished waterways.</p>

            <h2>Persecution and Diaspora</h2>
            <p>Though historically protected as "People of the Book" in Islamic jurisprudence, Mandaeans have faced increasing persecution in modern Iraq. After 2003, sectarian militias targeted them for perceived wealth (many worked as goldsmiths) and as unprotected minorities. Kidnappings, murders, and forced conversions drove mass exodus. Today, more Mandaeans live in Australia, Sweden, and the US than in Iraq. The diaspora struggles to maintain religious practice—rituals require priests, flowing water, and community. Young people drift away; priests age without successors. The religion faces possible extinction.</p>

            <h2>Silversmiths and Boat-Builders</h2>
            <p>Mandaeans traditionally specialized in silversmithing, goldsmithing, and boat-building—crafts transmitted through generations. Mandaean silver jewelry was renowned in Iraq. These trades provided economic niches that enabled community survival as a small minority. In diaspora, traditional occupations are less viable, and Mandaeans enter diverse professions. Yet craftwork remains important to identity, with some artisans continuing traditions in new countries. The loss of traditional economic specialization adds to challenges of cultural continuity.</p>
