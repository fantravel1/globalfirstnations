            <h2>Who Are the Ashanti?</h2>
            <p>The Ashanti (Asante) are an Akan people numbering approximately 10 million in Ghana's Ashanti Region, with diaspora worldwide. They speak Twi (an Akan language) and created one of Africa's most powerful pre-colonial states—the Ashanti Empire (1670-1900), which controlled much of modern Ghana and engaged European powers as equals until British conquest. Known for gold trade, the Golden Stool (national symbol), kente cloth, and sophisticated political organization, the Ashanti maintain strong cultural identity. The Asantehene (king) still commands enormous respect; the kingdom functions within Ghana's democratic framework.</p>

            <h2>The Golden Stool</h2>
            <p>The Sika Dwa Kofi (Golden Stool) is the Ashanti's supreme symbol—believed to contain the sunsum (soul) of the Ashanti nation. Legend holds it descended from the sky to the first Asantehene, Osei Tutu, in the late 17th century. The Stool never touches the ground; it has its own throne. When British Governor Hodgson demanded to sit on it (1900), the resulting War of the Golden Stool demonstrated its sacred importance—Ashanti would die rather than surrender it. The Stool was hidden and remains with the Asantehene; it appears only on rare ceremonial occasions. No one sits on it, not even the king.</p>

            <h2>Kente Cloth</h2>
            <p>Kente is Ghana's most recognizable textile—hand-woven strips of silk and cotton in brilliant colors and intricate geometric patterns, sewn together into larger cloths. Originally royal cloth restricted to the Asantehene and nobility, kente has become widely worn for important occasions across Ghana and the African diaspora. Each pattern has a name and meaning; colors carry symbolism (gold for royalty, green for growth, etc.). Master weavers in Bonwire village maintain traditional techniques. Kente has become globally recognized as African cultural expression—though mass-produced imitations raise authenticity concerns.</p>

            <h2>Political Organization</h2>
            <p>The Ashanti Empire developed sophisticated governance: the Asantehene ruled with advice from the council of divisional chiefs; provinces maintained autonomy within the union; the Golden Stool symbolized collective identity. Women held significant power—the Asantehemaa (queen mother) influenced succession and governance. The annual Odwira festival renewed political bonds. This organization allowed the Ashanti to dominate the gold and slave trades, resist European encroachment longer than most African states, and maintain identity after British conquest. Today's Asantehene (Otumfuo Osei Tutu II, since 1999) is a globally respected figure combining traditional authority with modern diplomacy.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Ashanti</h2>
            <p>The Ashanti Kingdom persists within Ghana's democratic republic—the Asantehene holds no formal political office but commands tremendous cultural authority and soft power. Kumasi, the traditional capital, is Ghana's second city. Traditional festivals, chieftaincy institutions, and customary law continue alongside modern governance. Economic activities include cocoa farming, gold mining, and trade. Debates about the role of traditional authority in modern democracy continue—some see chiefs as important cultural institutions, others as obstacles to progress. How the Ashanti balance traditional kingdom with republican citizenship exemplifies broader African questions about chieftaincy and modernity.</p>
