            <h2>Who Are the Waorani?</h2>
            <p>The **Waorani** (also Huaorani, Waodani) are an indigenous people of the Ecuadorian Amazon, inhabiting the rainforest between the Napo and Curaray rivers. Numbering approximately **4,800 people** today, the Waorani were historically known for their fierce resistance to outsiders—killing missionaries, oil workers, and neighboring indigenous peoples alike. Their language, **Wao Terero**, is a language isolate unrelated to any other known language, suggesting long isolation. The Waorani became internationally famous after the 1956 killing of five American missionaries—an event that, paradoxically, led to missionary contact, settlement, and dramatic cultural change. Today they navigate between defending their territory from oil extraction and adapting to modern Ecuadorian society.</p>

            <h2>A Culture of Warriors</h2>
            <p>Traditional Waorani society was extraordinarily violent by any measure. Anthropologists estimate that **over 60% of adult deaths** were from homicide—primarily spear killings in raids and feuds. The Waorani attacked outsiders on sight: rubber tappers, oil explorers, neighboring tribes, and missionaries all fell to their spears. Internal feuds between kin groups (nanicabo) drove cycles of revenge killing spanning generations. Young men gained status through killing; old age was rare. This violence reflected both defensive strategy—isolation protected against diseases and enslavement—and a cultural logic where vengeance was obligatory. The **blowgun** with curare-poisoned darts was used for hunting; the **spear** was the weapon of war. This culture of violence began transforming only after missionary contact in the late 1950s.</p>

            <h2>Missionary Contact and Transformation</h2>
            <p>On January 8, 1956, five American missionaries—including **Jim Elliot** and **Nate Saint**—were killed by Waorani warriors on a sandbar in the Curaray River. The event became international news and a foundational narrative for evangelical missions. Remarkably, the missionaries' family members—including Elisabeth Elliot and Rachel Saint—later lived among the Waorani, establishing peaceful contact. Rachel Saint spent decades with the Waorani, concentrated them into a settlement at Tiwaeno, converted many to Christianity, and worked to end killing. This transformation was dramatic: intergroup raiding largely ceased; the population, previously declining from violence, began growing. Critics argue the settlement disrupted sustainable dispersed living, introduced diseases, and made the Waorani vulnerable to oil company encroachment on their newly-concentrated territory.</p>

            <h2>Oil and Territory</h2>
            <p>The Waorani homeland sits atop some of Ecuador's largest oil reserves. Since the 1970s, oil extraction has transformed the region—roads cut through forest, pollution contaminates rivers, and colonists follow access routes into indigenous territory. The Waorani response has been mixed: some communities have negotiated with oil companies, receiving payments and services; others fiercely resist. In 2019, the Waorani won a landmark court case protecting **500,000 acres** from oil auction—a major victory for indigenous territorial rights. Yet extraction continues in other areas. Two Waorani clans—the **Tagaeri** and **Taromenane**—remain in voluntary isolation, rejecting all outside contact and occasionally killing intruders. Ecuador officially protects their territory, but enforcement is difficult. The Waorani situation exemplifies the global conflict between extractive industries and indigenous land rights.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Waorani</h2>
            <p>Today's Waorani live in approximately 40 communities across their legally recognized territory. Most are nominally Christian; traditional beliefs persist but transformed. Hunting with blowguns continues, though shotguns are now common. Education in Spanish integrates Waorani youth into Ecuadorian society; some attend university and become professionals. Traditional knowledge—plant medicine, forest ecology, hunting skills—erodes as elders die and youth orient toward town life. Political organization has strengthened: the **NAWE** (Waorani Nationality of Ecuador) represents Waorani interests in negotiations with government and companies. Women like **Nemonte Nenquimo** have become international voices for Amazon protection. The Waorani transformation—from isolated warriors to political actors in global environmentalism—spans barely 70 years, one of the fastest and most documented cultural transitions in anthropological history.</p>
