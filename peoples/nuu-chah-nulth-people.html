            <h2>Who Are the Nuu-chah-nulth?</h2>
            <p>The Nuu-chah-nulth (historically called Nootka by Europeans) are a First Nations people of the west coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. Numbering approximately 9,500-10,000, they comprise 14 member nations of the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council. They speak Nuu-chah-nulth (also Nootka), a Southern Wakashan language. The name means "all along the mountains and sea," reflecting their territory's dramatic landscape. The Nuu-chah-nulth are one of the few peoples worldwide who traditionally hunted whales from open canoes—a practice requiring extraordinary skill, courage, and spiritual preparation that distinguished them among Northwest Coast cultures.</p>

            <h2>Whale Hunting</h2>
            <p>Nuu-chah-nulth whaling was among the most demanding and prestigious pursuits on the Northwest Coast. Hereditary whaling chiefs (ha'wiih) held rights to hunt whales, acquired through inheritance and validated through rigorous spiritual preparation including fasting, ritual bathing, and prayer. Crews of eight paddled large canoes to intercept gray and humpback whales during migration. Harpoons with detachable heads and multiple floats tired the whale until it could be killed and towed to shore. A successful whale provided food, oil, and materials for the entire community, distributed according to protocol. The spiritual dimensions were as important as technical skill; whalers sought power from supernatural beings. Commercial whaling and conservation restrictions ended traditional whaling, though the Makah (related Washington State tribe) controversially revived the practice in 1999.</p>

            <h2>First Contact</h2>
            <p>The Nuu-chah-nulth were among the first Northwest Coast peoples contacted by Europeans. Spanish explorer Juan Pérez arrived in 1774; British captain James Cook spent a month at Nootka Sound in 1778. Cook's accounts described Nuu-chah-nulth culture and sparked the maritime fur trade. Nootka Sound became an international flashpoint: Spain and Britain nearly went to war over territorial claims (the Nootka Crisis, 1790). The Nuu-chah-nulth engaged in trade, sometimes manipulating European rivalries. Chief Maquinna became famous for his diplomatic skills. However, epidemics devastated populations; social disruption followed. The Nuu-chah-nulth's central role in early colonial history distinguishes their experience from more isolated Northwest Coast peoples.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Nuu-chah-nulth</h2>
            <p>Modern Nuu-chah-nulth live in communities along Vancouver Island's west coast, including Ahousaht, Tofino-Clayoquot, Ucluelet, and others. The Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council provides political representation and services. Fishing remains economically and culturally central; conflicts over fisheries—commercial, sport, and Indigenous—continue. The Maa-nulth Treaty (2011), ratified by five nations, was the first modern treaty on Vancouver Island. Other nations continue negotiations or pursue rights through litigation. The Nuu-chah-nulth language is endangered but documented; revitalization efforts continue. Cultural revival includes canoe journeys, potlatches, and traditional arts. Tourism to Clayoquot Sound and Pacific Rim National Park Reserve provides economic opportunities. The Nuu-chah-nulth demonstrate how treaty-making and litigation can advance Indigenous rights while communities maintain cultural traditions.</p>
