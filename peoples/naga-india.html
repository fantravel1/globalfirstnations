            <h2>Who Are the Nagas?</h2>
            <p>The Nagas are an ethnolinguistic group comprising approximately 60 distinct tribes, numbering 3-4 million across India's Nagaland, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, and Assam, plus Myanmar's Sagaing Region. They speak Tibeto-Burman languages, often mutually unintelligible between tribes. Historically, Nagas were warriors practicing headhunting and maintaining fierce tribal independence. British colonization, followed by American Baptist conversion (now 90%+ Christian), transformed society. The Naga independence movement—Asia's oldest insurgency—has fought India since 1947, seeking a sovereign "Nagalim" uniting all Naga-inhabited areas. Peace negotiations continue without resolution.</p>

            <h2>Headhunting Heritage</h2>
            <p>Traditional Naga society was organized around headhunting—the taking of enemy heads to capture spiritual power, demonstrate warrior prowess, and bring prosperity to villages. Elaborate feasts (Feasts of Merit) allowed successful warriors and wealthy individuals to gain status. Warriors wore distinctive headdresses, tattoos, and ornaments indicating their achievements. Villages were fortified against raids; inter-tribal warfare was endemic. British suppression and Christian conversion ended headhunting by the mid-20th century, but its cultural significance persists in ceremonies, dress, and the continuing emphasis on warrior identity.</p>

            <h2>The Independence Movement</h2>
            <p>Naga nationalism predates Indian independence—the Naga National Council declared independence in 1947, refusing incorporation into India. The resulting insurgency, Asia's longest, has involved multiple factions fighting for sovereignty or autonomy. India's counterinsurgency employed controversial tactics; mass violence, displacement, and human rights violations occurred. Ceasefires since 1997 between India and the main rebel group (NSCN-IM) have reduced fighting but not resolved the conflict. Nagas seek unification of Naga-inhabited areas across state and international boundaries—demands India refuses. Peace talks continue, but generational trauma and unresolved grievances persist.</p>

            <h2>Hornbill Festival</h2>
            <p>The Hornbill Festival, held annually in December at Kisama village near Kohima, showcases Naga cultural diversity. All major tribes participate, performing traditional dances, displaying crafts, and demonstrating cultural practices. Named for the Great Hornbill bird—culturally significant across Naga tribes—the festival promotes tourism and tribal unity. Events include traditional sports, beauty pageants, music (both traditional and contemporary Naga rock), and food. The festival, started in 2000, represents contemporary Naga identity construction—celebrating warrior heritage while projecting modernity and intra-tribal solidarity to Indian and international audiences.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Naga Society</h2>
            <p>Modern Naga society is overwhelmingly Christian—primarily Baptist, though Catholic and other denominations exist. Churches play central community roles; Sunday attendance is near-universal. This transformation from animist headhunters to devout Christians within a century represents dramatic cultural change. Education levels are high; English is widely spoken. Yet traditional governance (village councils, tribal structures) persists alongside modern institutions. How Nagas balance Christian modernity, traditional identity, and political aspirations while navigating an unresolved conflict with India defines contemporary challenges. The quest for Nagalim—a unified Naga homeland—remains central to collective identity.</p>
