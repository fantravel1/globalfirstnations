            <h2>Who Are the Kolam?</h2>
            <p>The Kolam are an indigenous tribal people of the Deccan Plateau in central-south India, primarily inhabiting the hill regions of Maharashtra, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh. Numbering approximately 400,000-500,000, they are concentrated in areas like the Adilabad and Yavatmal districts. The Kolam speak Kolami, a Central Dravidian language, distinct from both the Indo-Aryan and Munda languages of neighboring tribal groups. Classified as a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) in Maharashtra, the Kolam face significant challenges of poverty, land alienation, and marginalization while maintaining distinctive cultural practices.</p>

            <h2>Hill Agriculture</h2>
            <p>Traditional Kolam economy centered on shifting cultivation in the forested hills of the Deccan. Families cleared patches of forest, burned vegetation, and cultivated for several seasons before moving to new areas. Major crops included millets, pulses, and oilseeds suited to hilly terrain with limited irrigation. Forests provided supplementary resources: fruits, roots, honey, medicines, and building materials. Hunting and gathering remained important until forest restrictions limited access. The Kolam also raised small livestock and poultry. Cash needs were met through sale of forest products and seasonal agricultural labor. Government programs have encouraged settled agriculture, but many Kolam continue modified shifting cultivation where forest access permits.</p>

            <h2>Koya Cult</h2>
            <p>Traditional Kolam religion centers on the Koya or Koddapodu cult, involving worship of hill deities, ancestral spirits, and nature powers. Ritual specialists (Pujari) conduct ceremonies at sacred groves and stone shrines, offering animals and agricultural products. The Kathuli dance performed during festivals involves distinctive movements and costumes. Marriage and death ceremonies follow traditional patterns, though Hindu influences have modified some practices. Like many Deccan tribal groups, the Kolam have experienced pressure to Hinduize, with some adopting Hindu deities and customs while others maintain traditional religion. This religious negotiation reflects broader processes of cultural change affecting India's tribal populations.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Kolam</h2>
            <p>Modern Kolam face severe marginalization. Many have lost traditional lands to non-tribal settlers and moneylenders; bonded labor has affected some families. Forest restrictions have undermined traditional livelihoods without providing adequate alternatives. Health indicators are poor; malnutrition rates are high. Educational access is improving but remains limited in remote areas. Seasonal migration for agricultural and construction labor is common. Government programs targeting PVTG communities provide some support, but implementation is uneven. Kolam political organization remains limited compared to larger tribal movements. Some Kolam have accessed education and employment opportunities; others remain in extreme poverty. The Kolam case illustrates the challenges facing India's smaller, more vulnerable tribal groups.</p>
