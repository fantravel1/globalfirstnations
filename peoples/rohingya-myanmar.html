            <h2>Who Are the Rohingya?</h2>
            <p>The Rohingya are a Muslim ethnic group from Rakhine State in western Myanmar (Burma). Approximately 1.1 million Rohingya now live as refugees in Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar camps—the world's largest refugee settlement—after fleeing military "clearance operations" in 2017 that the UN characterized as genocide. Perhaps 600,000 remain in Myanmar under severe restrictions. Smaller communities exist in Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, and elsewhere. Myanmar considers the Rohingya illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, denying them citizenship despite historical presence dating back generations. This statelessness has enabled systematic persecution.</p>

            <h2>Denied Existence</h2>
            <p>Myanmar does not recognize the term "Rohingya," claiming no such ethnicity exists. A 1982 citizenship law excluded Rohingya from recognized ethnic groups, rendering them stateless. They cannot vote, travel freely, access education or healthcare, or practice their religion openly. This denial of identity underpins persecution—if Rohingya don't exist as a people, their rights need not be recognized. Yet Rohingya trace their presence in Arakan (Rakhine) for centuries, maintaining distinct language, culture, and Islamic faith distinct from Bangladeshi populations across the border.</p>

            <h2>The 2017 Genocide</h2>
            <p>In August 2017, Myanmar's military launched systematic attacks on Rohingya villages following insurgent attacks on police posts. Soldiers killed thousands (estimates range to over 10,000), gang-raped women and girls, burned villages, and forced 740,000+ people across the border into Bangladesh. UN investigators found "genocidal intent" and recommended prosecution of military commanders. The International Court of Justice ordered Myanmar to protect Rohingya. Yet accountability remains elusive, and conditions for those remaining in Myanmar have not improved. The crisis continues.</p>

            <h2>Life in the Camps</h2>
            <p>Cox's Bazar's Kutupalong camp and surroundings now house over 1 million Rohingya in bamboo shelters on deforested hillsides vulnerable to monsoons and fires. Bangladesh restricts formal employment and education, leaving refugees dependent on humanitarian aid. Child marriage, trafficking, and mental health crises have increased. Yet camp residents maintain community, establish informal schools, and document atrocities through testimony. International funding has declined even as needs persist. Proposed repatriation remains impossible while Myanmar refuses citizenship or safety guarantees.</p>

            <h2>Diaspora and Advocacy</h2>
            <p>Rohingya activists globally have mobilized to document atrocities, lobby governments, and pursue justice. Organizations collect testimony, preserve evidence, and support survivors. Social media has enabled Rohingya voices to reach global audiences. Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi's defense of the military at the ICJ shocked the international community. The Rohingya crisis has become a test case for international accountability mechanisms. Yet despite genocide determinations and court cases, Rohingya remain stateless and unable to return home safely.</p>
