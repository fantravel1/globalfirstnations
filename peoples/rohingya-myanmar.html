            <h2>Who Are the Rohingya?</h2>
            <p>The Rohingya are a Muslim ethnic group historically inhabiting Myanmar's Rakhine State, numbering approximately 2 million (though population is uncertain due to displacement). They speak Rohingya, an Indo-Aryan language related to Bengali dialects, and practice Sunni Islam. The Rohingya trace their presence in Rakhine (Arakan) to at least the 15th century, though Myanmar's government considers them illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Since 2017, military campaigns have driven over 700,000 Rohingya to Bangladesh in what the UN has characterized as genocide. They remain stateless—denied citizenship by Myanmar, unwelcome everywhere, surviving in refugee camps.</p>

            <h2>Denial of Identity</h2>
            <p>Myanmar has systematically stripped Rohingya of identity and rights. The 1982 Citizenship Law excluded Rohingya from recognized ethnic groups, rendering them stateless. They cannot travel freely, access education or healthcare, own property, or work in government. Marriages and births require permission. Myanmar refuses to use the term "Rohingya," calling them "Bengali" to imply foreignness. This denial of existence—claiming the Rohingya simply don't exist as a people—enables their persecution. The international recognition that Rohingya are indeed a distinct ethnic group with historical presence in Myanmar challenges this erasure.</p>

            <h2>The 2017 Genocide</h2>
            <p>In August 2017, Myanmar's military launched "clearance operations" in Rakhine State following militant attacks. The campaign involved mass killings (estimates of 10,000+ deaths), systematic rape, and village burning—over 350 villages destroyed. 700,000+ Rohingya fled to Bangladesh in weeks, the fastest refugee exodus since Rwanda. The UN fact-finding mission documented genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes; it recommended prosecution of senior military officials including Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing. The International Court of Justice ordered Myanmar to protect Rohingya from genocide. Yet accountability remains elusive.</p>

            <h2>Refugee Crisis</h2>
            <p>Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh hosts the world's largest refugee camp—over 900,000 Rohingya in overcrowded, flood-prone settlements. Conditions are dire: limited food, education, healthcare, and work opportunities. Bangladesh, itself poor, never signed the Refugee Convention and wants repatriation. Myanmar has made token readiness gestures while conditions remain unsafe. Some refugees have been moved to Bhasan Char, a flood-prone island. Trafficking, crime, and hopelessness plague camps. Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand have intercepted boats fleeing by sea. The Rohingya are trapped—unable to return, unwanted where they are, unable to move forward.</p>

            <h2>Future Prospects</h2>
            <p>The 2021 Myanmar coup further complicated the Rohingya situation—the military that committed genocide now faces resistance from pro-democracy forces who also historically supported anti-Rohingya policies. Some opposition groups have apologized and invited Rohingya participation; others remain hostile. International Court of Justice and International Criminal Court proceedings continue slowly. Diaspora Rohingya advocate for justice. The possibility of safe, dignified return seems distant. Whether the Rohingya can survive as a people—maintaining culture and identity across refugee camps and scattered diaspora—while waiting for justice defines their existential crisis.</p>
