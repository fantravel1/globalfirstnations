            <h2>Who Are the Nuxalk?</h2>
            <p>The Nuxalk (historically called Bella Coola by Europeans) are a First Nations people of the central coast of British Columbia, Canada, inhabiting the Bella Coola Valley and Dean Channel region. Numbering approximately 1,500-2,000, they speak Nuxalk (also called Bella Coola), a Salishan language—the northernmost member of this language family, geographically separated from other Salishan peoples by Wakashan-speaking neighbors. This isolation has given Nuxalk unique linguistic features, including complex consonant clusters challenging even for linguists. The Nuxalk are renowned for their elaborate ceremonial traditions, particularly the sisaok (winter dance) ceremonies featuring masked performances representing supernatural encounters.</p>

            <h2>Masked Ceremonies</h2>
            <p>Nuxalk ceremonial life features elaborate masked dances representing beings from the supernatural world. The sisaok (winter ceremonial) season involved performances where dancers, possessed by supernatural beings, enacted sacred dramas. Masks—intricately carved and often featuring moving parts—represented various beings: Raven, Thunderbird, Echo, and many others. Initiation into dance societies marked social transitions; different ceremonies were owned by families and performed by hereditary right. The kusiut (secret society) ceremonies were particularly elaborate. Missionary and governmental suppression damaged these traditions; masks were confiscated or sold. Contemporary Nuxalk have revived ceremonial practices, though much knowledge was lost. Mask-making has revived as both cultural practice and art form.</p>

            <h2>Alexander Mackenzie</h2>
            <p>The Nuxalk entered European historical records through Alexander Mackenzie's 1793 transcontinental expedition. Mackenzie became the first European to cross North America north of Mexico, reaching the Pacific at Bella Coola—but only with crucial Nuxalk assistance. Nuxalk guides led Mackenzie through their territory to the coast. Mackenzie's famous rock inscription ("from Canada by land...") was painted on a rock already marked by Nuxalk. This encounter, initially cooperative, presaged difficult changes. Epidemics devastated the population; by the late 19th century, perhaps 90% had died from introduced diseases. The survivors consolidated into a single village, Q'umk'uts' (Bella Coola), where most Nuxalk live today.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Nuxalk</h2>
            <p>Modern Nuxalk live primarily in Bella Coola, a remote community at the head of Burke Channel. The isolation that once protected Nuxalk culture continues to shape community life. Fishing remains important economically and culturally. The Nuxalk language is critically endangered; only elderly fluent speakers remain, though revitalization programs work to teach younger generations. Cultural revival includes mask carving, potlatch ceremonies, and traditional food practices. The Nuxalk have been involved in environmental advocacy, particularly regarding logging and fish farm impacts. Tourism provides economic opportunities through guided wilderness experiences. Treaty negotiations with Canada continue. The Nuxalk demonstrate how small, isolated Indigenous communities maintain cultural identity while facing the challenges of remoteness and language loss.</p>
