            <h2>Who Are the Talysh?</h2>
            <p>The Talysh are an Iranian people indigenous to the southwestern Caspian coast, straddling the border between Azerbaijan and Iran. Numbering between 500,000 and 1,000,000 (exact figures are disputed), they inhabit the Talysh Mountains and adjacent coastal lowlands—one of the most biodiverse regions of the Middle East, with lush forests receiving over 1,500mm of annual rainfall. Their Northwestern Iranian language, Talyshi, connects them to the ancient Medes and Persians, while their geographic position has shaped a distinctive culture blending highland and coastal traditions.</p>

            </div>

            <h2>The Caspian Rainforest</h2>
            <p>The Talysh homeland includes remnants of the Hyrcanian forests—a UNESCO World Heritage Site representing ancient temperate rainforests that survived the Ice Ages. These forests contain tree species found nowhere else, including the Persian ironwood (Parrotia persica), while wildlife includes leopards, wild boar, and diverse bird species. The Talysh developed an economy based on this unique environment: rice cultivation in the humid lowlands, fruit orchards on mountain slopes, and forest products from higher elevations.</p>
            <p>This environment created distinctive foodways. Talysh cuisine emphasizes rice, fish (from both the Caspian and mountain streams), herbs gathered from forests, and fruits—especially citrus, pomegranates, and persimmons. Tea drinking is ubiquitous, supported by local tea cultivation. The green, misty landscape shapes Talysh aesthetics and poetry, with nature imagery pervading literature and song.</p>

            <h2>Language and Identity</h2>
            <p>The Talysh language belongs to the Northwestern Iranian branch, related to Kurdish, Gilaki, and Mazandarani rather than the Southwestern branch that includes Persian. This linguistic distinctiveness, along with geographic isolation, has maintained Talysh identity despite centuries under various empires—Persian, Russian, and now Iranian and Azerbaijani states.</p>
            <p>In Azerbaijan, Talysh identity has been politically sensitive. Soviet-era census manipulation undercounted Talysh, and post-Soviet Azerbaijani policies have been criticized for suppressing Talysh language and identity. In 1993, a short-lived "Talysh-Mughan Republic" was declared before being suppressed by Azerbaijani forces. Activists advocating for Talysh language rights have faced persecution, and the community remains divided between those emphasizing Azerbaijani integration and those seeking greater cultural autonomy.</p>

            <h2>Traditional Life</h2>
            <p>Traditional Talysh society combined lowland rice farming with upland pastoralism and forest use. Seasonal migration (transhumance) moved livestock between winter lowland pastures and summer mountain meadows. Villages were typically compact, with houses built of stone and wood to withstand the heavy rainfall. Extended family households worked collectively, and villages maintained communal systems for irrigation, road maintenance, and mutual aid.</p>
            <p>The Talysh traditionally followed Shia Islam, like their Iranian kin, distinguishing them from predominantly Sunni Kurds to the west. Religious practice blended with pre-Islamic traditions, including veneration of sacred trees, springs, and hilltop shrines. Nowruz (Persian New Year) remains the most important festival, celebrated with special foods, bonfires, and family gatherings.</p>

            <h2>Music and Arts</h2>
            <p>Talysh music reflects both Iranian and Caucasian influences. Traditional instruments include the tar (long-necked lute), kamancheh (spike fiddle), and various drums. Ashiq (bard) traditions preserve epic poetry and historical songs, while folk music accompanies weddings, harvests, and religious occasions. The mugham modal system, shared with Azerbaijani music, structures classical performance.</p>
            <p>Talysh poetry has a rich tradition, with poets writing in both Talyshi and Persian. Contemporary Talysh literature explores themes of identity, nature, and the challenges of minority existence. Folk arts include carpet weaving with distinctive regional patterns, embroidery, and woodcraft using the abundant local timber. These traditions continue, though economic pressures and cultural assimilation pose challenges.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Situation</h2>
            <p>Today's Talysh face different pressures in Iran and Azerbaijan. In Iran, they are part of the Iranian nation with religious (Shia) and cultural commonalities, though their language lacks official status and education is in Persian. In Azerbaijan, ethnic nationalism, post-conflict tensions (the region borders areas affected by the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict), and centralization policies constrain Talysh cultural expression.</p>
            <p>Diaspora communities in Russia, Europe, and North America maintain connections and advocacy. Digital platforms enable Talysh-language content to reach new audiences. Young Talysh increasingly explore their heritage, learning the language, studying history, and connecting across borders. Their future depends on the policies of host states and the determination of the community to maintain identity while adapting to modern conditions.</p>
