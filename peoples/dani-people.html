            <h2>Who Are the Dani?</h2>
            <p>The Dani are a Papuan people of the Baliem Valley in the highlands of West Papua (Papua Province, Indonesia), numbering approximately 250,000. They speak Dani, a Trans-New Guinea language with several dialects. The Dani remained unknown to the outside world until 1938, when American explorers discovered their populous valley high in the central highlands. Their sophisticated agricultural society, elaborate rituals, and tradition of ritualized warfare captured worldwide attention. The Dani represent one of the last major populations to make contact with the modern world, and their culture—though rapidly changing—offers insights into highland Papuan societies.</p>

            <h2>Agricultural Society</h2>
            <p>The Dani developed sophisticated agriculture in the highland valleys, centered on sweet potato cultivation—introduced to New Guinea approximately 300-400 years ago, transforming highland societies. They created elaborate drainage systems, raised garden beds, and composting techniques that allowed intensive cultivation supporting dense populations. Pigs held enormous social and ritual importance—pig feasts marked major events and demonstrated wealth and status. Men traditionally wore only koteka (penis gourds), while women wore grass skirts. Villages consisted of circular fenced compounds with men's houses, women's houses, and pig styes. This agricultural system, combined with pig husbandry, sustained one of the most populous regions of pre-contact New Guinea.</p>

            <h2>Ritual Warfare</h2>
            <p>Traditional Dani society featured elaborate ritual warfare between neighboring groups. Battles followed strict conventions—arranged by mutual agreement at set locations, with periods of fighting followed by truces. Deaths required revenge, perpetuating cycles of conflict, but the fighting was relatively restrained compared to total war. Warfare served social functions including status competition, territorial defense, and ritual obligation to avenge deaths. Warriors decorated themselves with feathers, shells, and pig grease. This warfare was documented in the classic ethnographic film "Dead Birds" (1964). Indonesian government policy and missionary activity have largely suppressed warfare since the 1960s, fundamentally changing social organization.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Dani</h2>
            <p>Modern Dani life has transformed dramatically under Indonesian rule. Traditional warfare, practices like finger amputation for mourning, and many rituals have been suppressed. Christianity has spread widely. Cash economy has penetrated the valley, with some Dani participating in tourism (the Baliem Valley Festival attracts visitors). Education and Indonesian language use increase. Yet aspects of traditional culture persist—agricultural practices, pig exchanges, some rituals, and customary social organization continue alongside change. West Papua's political situation—indigenous peoples' resistance to Indonesian rule, immigration from other Indonesian islands, and resource extraction—creates ongoing tensions. The Dani navigate between traditional culture, Indonesian citizenship, and the global economy, their remote highland valley no longer isolated from world systems.</p>
