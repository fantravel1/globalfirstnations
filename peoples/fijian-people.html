            <h2>Who Are the Fijians?</h2>
            <p>The indigenous Fijians (iTaukei) are a Melanesian-Polynesian people numbering approximately 475,000—about 57% of Fiji's population, alongside Indo-Fijians (37%) descended from indentured laborers. They speak Fijian (Vosa Vakaviti), an Austronesian language with significant regional dialects. Fiji's 330 islands sit at the crossroads of Melanesia and Polynesia, reflected in Fijian culture blending both traditions. The iTaukei maintained complex chiefdom societies before British colonization (1874). Post-independence (1970), ethnic politics between iTaukei and Indo-Fijians have shaped Fiji's turbulent democracy, including four coups since 1987.</p>

            <h2>Island Civilization</h2>
            <p>Fiji was settled around 1500-1000 BCE by Lapita people. Society developed into complex chiefdoms—the Vunivalu (war chief) and Roko Tui (sacred chief) system organized power. Cannibalism and warfare characterized pre-contact society; the "cannibal isles" reputation influenced European perceptions. Skilled navigation enabled inter-island contact; double-hulled canoes (drua) were the Pacific's largest. Masi (tapa cloth), pottery, and intricate woodcarving demonstrate artistic traditions. The elaborate meke (dance and song) continues today. Fiji's position made it a cultural mixing zone—Melanesian roots with Polynesian influence from neighboring Tonga.</p>

            <h2>Colonial Era</h2>
            <p>European contact (17th century) and missionaries (19th century) transformed Fiji. Chief Cakobau ceded Fiji to Britain (1874) to resolve debts and internal conflicts. Colonial sugar plantations imported 60,000+ Indian laborers (1879-1916), creating the Indo-Fijian community. The British maintained chiefly authority through indirect rule; the Great Council of Chiefs became powerful institution. Land was protected—83% remains communal iTaukei land. Independence (1970) established parliamentary democracy, but ethnic tensions between majority land-owning iTaukei and economically successful Indo-Fijians created instability.</p>

            <h2>Post-Independence Turbulence</h2>
            <p>Fiji has experienced four coups since 1987, often framed in ethnic terms. Indo-Fijian-led governments were overthrown (1987, 2000); a 2006 coup removed an iTaukei nationalist government. Commander Frank Bainimarama's 2006 coup led to military rule until 2014 elections. The 2013 constitution removed race-based voting and reduced chiefly privileges, promoting "Fijian" identity for all citizens. These changes are controversial—traditional iTaukei leaders oppose diminished recognition. Indo-Fijian emigration has shifted demographics; iTaukei percentage grows. How Fiji balances communal land rights, democratic governance, and multiethnic identity remains contested.</p>

            <h2>iTaukei Culture Today</h2>
            <p>Traditional iTaukei culture remains vibrant. Kava (yaqona) ceremonies structure social and political occasions—the formal sevusevu presentation is essential protocol. The village (koro) remains social unit; communal obligations (kerekere) share resources. Meke performances preserve oral history; masi and pottery crafts continue. Christianity (mainly Methodist) dominates, integrated with cultural practices. Tourism provides income but also commodifies culture. Rugby union inspires national passion—Fiji's sevens team is globally dominant. The vanua concept—land, people, and custom interconnected—expresses iTaukei identity. How this identity evolves alongside democratic, multiethnic citizenship shapes Fiji's future.</p>
