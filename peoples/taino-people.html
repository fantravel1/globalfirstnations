            <h2>Who Are the Taíno?</h2>
            <p>The Taíno were the indigenous people of the Caribbean who inhabited the Greater Antilles (Cuba, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, Jamaica) and the Bahamas when Columbus arrived in 1492. Before contact, they numbered perhaps 250,000-1,000,000 or more. They spoke Taíno, an Arawakan language now extinct. The Taíno were the first indigenous Americans encountered by Columbus, and their experience of conquest—enslavement, disease, violence, and near-total population collapse within decades—foreshadowed what would unfold across the Americas. Long considered extinct, recent genetic studies and cultural revival movements have demonstrated Taíno survival and sparked renewed interest in Taíno identity among Caribbean populations.</p>

            <h2>Pre-Contact Society</h2>
            <p>Taíno society was among the most complex in the Caribbean. They lived in villages (yucayeques) led by hereditary chiefs (caciques), with regional paramount chiefs controlling multiple villages. Society was hierarchically organized with chiefs, nobles (nitaínos), commoners, and servants. The Taíno cultivated cassava (manioc), sweet potatoes, corn, and other crops using sophisticated agricultural techniques including raised mounds (conucos). They were skilled fishers, using nets, hooks, and the remora fish to catch sea turtles. Their material culture included elaborate pottery, stone tools including three-pointed zemí figures representing spirits, carved wooden seats (duhos) for chiefs, and impressive dugout canoes. The ball game (batey), played on rectangular courts, held ritual significance.</p>

            <h2>Colonial Devastation</h2>
            <p>Columbus's arrival initiated catastrophe. The Spanish established the encomienda system, granting colonizers rights to indigenous labor. Taíno were forced into gold mining and agricultural work under brutal conditions. Those who resisted faced violence; the cacique Hatuey, who fled Hispaniola to warn Cuba, was burned at the stake. Epidemic diseases—smallpox, measles, typhus—swept through populations with no immunity. The Taíno population collapsed by perhaps 90% within decades. By 1550, the Taíno as a distinct population were considered effectively extinct, though survivors mixed with European and later African populations. Bartolomé de Las Casas documented these atrocities, advocating for indigenous rights.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Taíno</h2>
            <p>Recent decades have seen Taíno cultural revival and scientific reassessment. Genetic studies show significant indigenous ancestry in Caribbean populations, particularly in Puerto Rico where perhaps 15-20% of mitochondrial DNA is of indigenous origin. Cultural organizations in Puerto Rico, Cuba, Dominican Republic, and the diaspora have organized to revive Taíno identity, practices, and knowledge. This revival is contested—critics question authenticity while advocates argue for recognition of indigenous heritage. Taíno words (hammock, hurricane, tobacco, canoe, barbecue) entered world languages. Archaeological research continues revealing Taíno culture's sophistication. The Taíno experience—first contact, rapid devastation, presumed extinction, genetic and cultural survival—encapsulates indigenous American history and the possibilities of cultural revival.</p>
