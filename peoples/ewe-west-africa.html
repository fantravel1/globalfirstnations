            <h2>Who Are the Ewe?</h2>
            <p>The Ewe are a people of approximately 7-8 million across southeastern Ghana (Volta Region) and southern Togo and Benin. They speak Ewe, a Gbe language of the Niger-Congo family. The Ewe developed small-scale political organization (town-states) rather than centralized kingdoms, emphasizing local autonomy. They're renowned for two cultural contributions: sophisticated polyrhythmic drumming (influencing global music) and Vodun—the religious system that became Haitian Vodou through the Atlantic slave trade. The colonial partition divided Ewe between British Gold Coast and German/French Togoland, creating a people split across borders.</p>

            <h2>Ewe Drumming</h2>
            <p>Ewe drumming represents one of the world's most sophisticated polyrhythmic traditions. Multiple drums of different sizes (atsimevu, sogo, kidi, kaganu) interlock in complex patterns, each with distinct roles. Master drummers (with decades of training) communicate through drum language, improvise over rhythmic frameworks, and lead community celebrations. Dance and music are inseparable; each rhythm has associated movements. Ethnomusicologists have extensively studied Ewe drumming; it has influenced jazz, Afrobeat, and contemporary world music. The tradition demonstrates mathematical complexity in African music often underappreciated in Western analysis.</p>

            <h2>Vodun</h2>
            <p>Vodun (source of "voodoo") is the Ewe traditional religion—a system of deities (trowo), ancestral spirits, and religious practices that deeply influenced Haitian Vodou, Brazilian Candomblé, and Cuban Santería through enslaved Africans. Vodun involves shrines, priests (huno), divination, and ceremonies featuring possession by spirits. Despite Christian missionary efforts, Vodun remains practiced alongside Christianity—many Ewe maintain traditional shrines while attending church. Vodun's negative "voodoo" stereotypes in Western media reflect ignorance and prejudice; actual practice involves community ethics, healing, and spiritual connection. Contemporary Vodun is experiencing revival as cultural heritage.</p>

            <h2>Colonial Division</h2>
            <p>German colonization (1884) created Togoland colony encompassing most Ewe territory. After WWI, Britain and France divided Togoland—western areas (including Ewe heartland) joined British Gold Coast (later Ghana); eastern parts became French Togoland (later Togo). This partition divided Ewe between Ghana and Togo, separating families and communities. Post-independence Ewe unification movements failed; border tensions have occasionally flared. Today, Ewe navigate dual citizenship issues, cross-border trade, and divided families while maintaining cultural unity despite national separation. The border's porosity allows ongoing connection, but political division persists.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Ewe</h2>
            <p>Modern Ewe in Ghana are influential in national politics, commerce, and culture, though some perceive marginalization compared to Akan groups. Togo's Ewe have different political experiences, having produced several national leaders. Fishing, farming, and trade sustain coastal communities. Music and dance remain central—Ewe styles influence contemporary Ghanaian highlife and gospel. Kente weaving (shared with Ashanti but with distinctive Ewe patterns) provides income. How Ewe navigate their cross-border identity while participating in two different national systems—democratic Ghana and authoritarian Togo—shapes their diverse contemporary experiences.</p>
