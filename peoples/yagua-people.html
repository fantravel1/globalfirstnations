            <h2>Who Are the Yagua?</h2>
            <p>The Yagua (Yawa) are an indigenous people of the northeastern Peruvian and southeastern Colombian Amazon, numbering approximately 6,000-8,000 people along tributaries of the Amazon River near the Brazil-Peru-Colombia border. They speak Yagua, a Peba-Yaguan language with uncertain wider connections. The Yagua are renowned for their distinctive fiber skirts made from aguaje palm, their expert use of long blowguns with curare-tipped darts for hunting, and their traditional multi-family longhouses (maloca). Their territory in the lowland rainforest is rich in biodiversity and faces threats from logging, oil exploration, and colonization. The Yagua have maintained relatively traditional lifeways while engaging with tourism and market economies.</p>

            <h2>Blowgun Hunting</h2>
            <p>The Yagua are master craftsmen and users of the pucuna (blowgun), which can exceed 3 meters in length. Made from palm wood with a bore created by a patient straightening process, these blowguns launch small darts with remarkable accuracy. The darts are tipped with curare, a potent plant-based poison that causes paralysis without contaminating the meat. Hunting with blowguns requires extensive knowledge of animal behavior, forest ecology, and poison preparation. While shotguns have supplemented blowguns for some hunting, the traditional technique remains practiced and demonstrated for tourists. Blowgun making and use represent sophisticated indigenous technology adapted to rainforest hunting.</p>

            <h2>Palm Fiber Regalia</h2>
            <p>Traditional Yagua dress featured distinctive fiber skirts made from processed aguaje palm leaves, worn by both men and women. These voluminous skirts, along with headdresses and body paint, created the striking appearance recorded by early explorers and photographers. The fiber dress provided practical protection from insects and sun while serving aesthetic and ceremonial functions. While daily dress has largely shifted to commercial clothing, Yagua communities maintain traditional regalia for ceremonies and tourist performances. The fiber skirts have become iconic symbols of Yagua identity, recognized across Amazonia. Their production demonstrates sophisticated craft knowledge of palm processing.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Yagua</h2>
            <p>Modern Yagua communities navigate between subsistence and market economies. Near Iquitos, Peru's largest Amazon city, Yagua have engaged extensively with tourism—demonstrating blowguns, selling crafts, and performing dances. This tourism brings income but raises concerns about cultural commodification. More remote communities maintain traditional fishing, hunting, and horticulture. Logging, oil exploration, and agricultural colonization threaten Yagua territories. The Yagua language is classified as endangered, with younger generations increasingly speaking Spanish. Organizations work to secure land titles and support cultural preservation. The Yagua's location near the tri-border area exposes them to multiple national contexts and cross-border challenges.</p>
