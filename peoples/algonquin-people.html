            <h2>Who Are the Algonquin?</h2>
            <p>The Algonquin (Anishinaabe/Omàmiwinini) are an Algonquian-speaking First Nations people indigenous to the Ottawa River valley and adjacent regions of Quebec and Ontario, Canada. Numbering approximately 11,000-12,000, they live in ten recognized First Nations in Quebec and one in Ontario (Pikwàkanagàn). They speak Algonquin, an Anishinaabe language closely related to Ojibwe. Note: "Algonquin" the people is distinct from "Algonquian" the language family—the Algonquian family includes dozens of languages across northeastern North America, named after but much broader than the Algonquin nation. The Algonquin were the first indigenous people encountered by French explorers ascending the St. Lawrence, making them central to the early fur trade and colonial history.</p>

            <h2>French Alliance</h2>
            <p>The Algonquin established close relations with French colonizers beginning with Samuel de Champlain's arrival in 1603. In 1609, Champlain accompanied Algonquin and Huron warriors against the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois), initiating decades of alliance. This alliance shaped North American colonial history: the Algonquin supplied furs to French traders, guided explorers, and fought alongside the French against the Haudenosaunee and later the British. The fur trade transformed Algonquin economy and society, creating dependence on European goods while making them crucial intermediaries. However, Haudenosaunee attacks, supported by Dutch and English allies, devastated Algonquin communities in the mid-17th century, dispersing many people. After French defeat in 1760, the Algonquin came under British rule, beginning a long process of land loss and marginalization.</p>

            <h2>Land and Territory</h2>
            <p>Algonquin traditional territory encompasses the entire Ottawa River watershed—approximately 36,000 square miles spanning present-day Ontario and Quebec. This territory was never surrendered by treaty; unlike most of Ontario (covered by the Robinson treaties and numbered treaties), Algonquin territory was simply occupied without legal extinguishment of aboriginal title. Since 1991, the Algonquins of Ontario have negotiated a comprehensive land claim with the federal and Ontario governments. A 2016 Agreement-in-Principle would provide land, compensation, and self-government over 36,000 square kilometers—one of the largest land claims in Canadian history. However, negotiations continue, and the claim remains controversial both within and outside Algonquin communities. Some Algonquin bands in Quebec have pursued separate negotiations.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Algonquin</h2>
            <p>Modern Algonquin communities face typical First Nations challenges: poverty, inadequate housing, health disparities, and the legacy of residential schools. The Algonquin language is endangered, with most fluent speakers elderly, though revitalization programs exist. Governance varies: some communities use elected band councils under the Indian Act; others incorporate traditional elements. The ongoing land claim negotiations dominate political discussion. Economic development includes forestry, tourism, and various enterprises. Algonquin Park, Ontario's iconic wilderness area, was created within Algonquin territory without consent; the Algonquin had no management role until recent co-management agreements. Cultural revitalization includes language programs, traditional crafts, and reconnection to the land. The Algonquin demonstrate how First Nations in settled Canada work to reclaim rights and identity despite centuries of dispossession.</p>
