            <h2>Who Are the Iraqw?</h2>
            <p>The Iraqw are a Cushitic-speaking people of north-central Tanzania, inhabiting the highlands around Mbulu District and the slopes of the Rift Valley escarpment. Numbering approximately 500,000-600,000, they speak Iraqw (also written Iraqw), a South Cushitic language related to distantly to Somali and Oromo. The Iraqw are surrounded by Nilotic and Bantu-speaking peoples, making them a linguistic island of Cushitic speech in East Africa. Unlike many neighboring peoples who practice pastoralism, the Iraqw are primarily intensive agriculturalists, developing sophisticated farming techniques adapted to their highland environment. Their presence in Tanzania represents an ancient Cushitic population predating the migrations of Bantu and Nilotic peoples into the region.</p>

            <h2>Highland Agriculture</h2>
            <p>The Iraqw developed intensive agricultural systems adapted to the volcanic highlands of the Rift Valley. Terracing prevents soil erosion on steep slopes; manuring and crop rotation maintain fertility. The Iraqw grow maize, wheat, sorghum, beans, and vegetables. Traditional agriculture incorporated cattle, whose manure fertilized fields. The integration of crops and livestock created sustainable farming systems that supported dense populations. This agricultural intensification distinguishes the Iraqw from surrounding pastoral peoples like the Maasai and Datoga. The highland environment—cooler and wetter than surrounding lowlands—provides favorable conditions. Iraqw farmers have expanded their territory over generations, clearing forests and establishing farms in previously uninhabited areas.</p>

            <h2>Cosmology and Society</h2>
            <p>Traditional Iraqw religion centered on Looaa, a deity associated with the sun and sky, and various lesser spirits inhabiting the landscape. Diviners and ritual specialists maintained relationships with these powers. The annual cycle included agricultural rituals to ensure rainfall and harvests. Social organization featured clans (patrilineal descent groups) that regulated marriage and controlled land. Age-grade systems organized men into groups that progressed through life stages together. Women had defined roles in agricultural production and domestic life but limited formal political power. Christianity has made significant inroads among the Iraqw since the colonial period; many Iraqw today are Lutheran or Catholic, though traditional beliefs often persist alongside Christianity.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Iraqw</h2>
            <p>Modern Iraqw face land pressure as population growth strains the highland environment. Soil degradation and deforestation have intensified in recent decades. Migration to urban areas and to newly opened lands in other regions provides outlets for population pressure. Education has expanded; many Iraqw pursue secondary and higher education. The Iraqw language remains strong with good intergenerational transmission, though Swahili is increasingly important for education and commerce. Political organization has grown; Iraqw participate in Tanzanian national politics while maintaining ethnic identity. Cultural practices including traditional music, dance, and dress continue, sometimes adapted for tourism. The Iraqw demonstrate how intensive agriculture can support large populations in challenging environments while also showing the environmental limits of such intensification.</p>
