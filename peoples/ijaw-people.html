            <h2>Who Are the Ijaw?</h2>
            <p>The Ijaw (also Izon) are one of Nigeria's largest ethnic groups, numbering approximately 14-15 million people, making them the country's fourth or fifth largest ethnicity. They primarily inhabit the Niger Delta region spanning Bayelsa, Rivers, Delta, Ondo, and Edo states—a vast maze of creeks, mangroves, and swamps where the Niger River meets the Atlantic Ocean. The Ijaw speak a cluster of closely related languages of the Ijoid family, a unique Niger-Congo branch. Their aquatic environment shaped a distinctive culture centered on fishing, canoe transportation, and water spirits. The Ijaw homeland sits atop vast petroleum reserves, making them central figures in Nigerian oil politics and resource conflicts.</p>

            <h2>Delta Adaptation</h2>
            <p>Traditional Ijaw life was superbly adapted to the Niger Delta's aquatic environment. Fishing was the economic foundation—the delta's brackish waters and mangrove creeks supported abundant fish populations. Canoes were essential for transport, trade, and fishing; Ijaw canoe-building techniques produced craft suited to different water conditions. Villages occupied higher ground amid the swamps, connected by waterways rather than roads. Agriculture was limited by waterlogged soils; cassava, plantain, and some vegetables were cultivated on available dry land. Trade connected delta communities with interior peoples, exchanging fish and salt for agricultural products. The water spirit Owuamapu and other aquatic deities occupied central positions in Ijaw traditional religion.</p>

            <h2>Oil and Conflict</h2>
            <p>The discovery of petroleum in Ijaw territory (1956) transformed their situation dramatically. Nigeria's oil wealth comes largely from Ijaw lands, yet Ijaw communities have suffered oil spill pollution, gas flaring, and environmental devastation while receiving minimal benefits. This disparity fueled militant movements from the 1990s onward, including the Movement for the Survival of the Ijaw Ethnic Nationality and the Niger Delta People's Volunteer Force. Armed groups attacked oil installations and kidnapped workers, demanding resource control and environmental remediation. The federal amnesty program (2009) reduced violence, but grievances persist. The Ijaw case exemplifies the "resource curse" affecting indigenous peoples whose territories contain valuable resources.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Ijaw</h2>
            <p>Modern Ijaw communities navigate between traditional fishing livelihoods and the oil economy. Many fishing grounds have been destroyed by pollution; some Ijaw work for oil companies, while others continue traditional occupations in degraded environments. The amnesty program provided some ex-militants with education and employment opportunities. Political organization has grown; Ijaw leaders advocate for restructuring of Nigerian federalism, resource control, and environmental justice. The Kaiama Declaration (1998) articulated Ijaw demands for autonomy and resource control. Education has expanded; Ijaw professionals serve throughout Nigerian society. Cultural practices including the Egbesu masquerade tradition continue. The Ijaw represent indigenous peoples grappling with extractive industry impacts while seeking political empowerment and environmental restoration.</p>
