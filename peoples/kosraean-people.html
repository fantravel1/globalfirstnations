            <h2>Who Are the Kosraean?</h2>
            <p>The Kosraean are the indigenous Micronesian people of Kosrae (formerly Kusaie), the easternmost state of the Federated States of Micronesia, numbering approximately 7,000-8,000. They inhabit a single high volcanic island sometimes called the "Island of the Sleeping Lady" for its mountain profile. They speak Kosraean, an Oceanic Austronesian language. Kosrae was historically isolated from other Micronesian islands, developing distinctive cultural traits. American Protestant missionaries arrived in 1852, and today Kosrae is deeply Christian with Congregational churches central to community life. The island's mountains, rainforest, and coral reefs create remarkable natural beauty.</p>

            <h2>Ancient Lelu Ruins</h2>
            <p>Lelu, on an island off Kosrae's eastern coast, was the seat of the Tokosra (paramount chief) and contains impressive basalt ruins similar to, though smaller than, Pohnpei's Nan Madol. Stone walls, platforms, and canal systems date to 1250-1400 CE when a centralized chiefdom controlled the island. The ruins include royal compounds, tombs, and sacred areas. European contact brought devastating epidemics; by the mid-19th century, the population had collapsed from perhaps 6,000 to under 300. The chiefdom system collapsed with the population, leaving the ruins as testament to Kosrae's more complex past. Today, Lelu is a UNESCO World Heritage tentative site.</p>

            <h2>Christian Transformation</h2>
            <p>American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (Congregationalist) missionaries arrived in 1852, finding a traumatized population decimated by epidemics. Christianity took hold rapidly and thoroughly. The church became central to Kosraean identity; Sunday observance is strict. Traditional religion was largely abandoned, though some cultural elements persisted. Church buildings are the most prominent structures; pastors hold significant community influence. This thorough Christian conversion distinguishes Kosrae from islands where syncretism or dual belief systems developed. Understanding Kosraean society requires recognizing how completely Christianity reshaped cultural identity following the catastrophic population collapse.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Kosraean</h2>
            <p>Modern Kosrae is the FSM's smallest state, dependent on Compact funds, subsistence agriculture, and limited tourism. Citrus cultivation, particularly tangerines, provides some cash income. Kosrae's isolation—flights arrive only twice weekly—limits development but preserves environment. The island's pristine coral reefs attract divers. Young Kosraeans emigrate for education and employment; some return while others settle in Guam or the US. The church remains central to community life. Climate change threatens coastal areas and reef systems. How this small, deeply Christian island people maintains identity while navigating limited resources and emigration defines Kosrae's intimate community future.</p>
