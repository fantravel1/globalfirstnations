            <h2>Who Are the Baka?</h2>
            <p>The Baka are a forest-dwelling people numbering approximately 30,000-40,000 across the rainforests of Cameroon, Gabon, Republic of Congo, and Central African Republic. They speak Baka, an Ubangian language, and are one of several Central African "Pygmy" groups (though many consider this term pejorative)—peoples adapted over millennia to rainforest life. The Baka developed sophisticated knowledge of forest ecology, medicinal plants, and sustainable hunting-gathering. However, logging, conservation projects, and pressure from Bantu neighbors threaten their forest homeland and traditional way of life. The Baka represent both remarkable human adaptation and indigenous vulnerability.</p>

            <h2>Forest Knowledge</h2>
            <p>Baka possess extraordinary knowledge of the rainforest—identifying hundreds of plant species for food, medicine, tools, and ritual purposes. They track animals through subtle forest signs, construct shelters from available materials, and navigate without trails. Net hunting (using handmade nets to catch small game) involves complex coordination and demonstrates sophisticated cooperative strategies. This knowledge, accumulated over thousands of years, represents an irreplaceable human heritage. Yet as Baka are forced from forests, younger generations lose these skills. Documentation efforts attempt to preserve traditional knowledge, but living transmission requires forest access.</p>

            <h2>Music and Spirituality</h2>
            <p>Baka music—particularly their polyphonic singing—is internationally recognized for its beauty and complexity. Multiple voices interweave in harmonies developed without Western influence; yodeling and forest sounds incorporate into performances. Music accompanies all aspects of life: hunting preparations, healing ceremonies, storytelling, and spirit communication. Jengi, a forest spirit, plays a central spiritual role; the Jengi ceremony initiates boys into adulthood through forest rituals. These traditions encode cultural values, ecological knowledge, and community bonds. Baka musicians have collaborated with international artists, bringing their music global attention while raising questions about cultural appropriation.</p>

            <h2>Conservation Conflicts</h2>
            <p>Paradoxically, the Baka face threats from conservation projects meant to protect their forest. National parks and wildlife reserves have been created on traditional Baka territories, often excluding them from ancestral lands while allowing logging and safari tourism. "Fortress conservation" treats indigenous forest peoples as threats rather than partners. Baka report harassment, beatings, and eviction by park rangers. International conservation organizations have faced criticism for supporting projects that harm forest peoples. The Baka case demonstrates that conservation without indigenous rights can perpetuate colonialism rather than protect ecosystems.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Challenges</h2>
            <p>Modern Baka face multiple pressures: logging destroys forests; conservation excludes them; dominant Bantu populations discriminate against them (sometimes treating Baka as subhuman); sedentarization disrupts traditional patterns. Some Baka have settled in roadside villages, dependent on wage labor or aid, losing forest skills. Alcoholism and health problems affect displaced communities. Yet Baka resistance continues—legal challenges to conservation abuses, cultural revival efforts, and advocacy organizations. How Baka secure land rights, maintain forest access, and preserve culture while adapting to rapidly changing circumstances defines their struggle for survival.</p>
