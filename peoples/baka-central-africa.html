            <h2>Who Are the Baka?</h2>
            <p>The Baka are one of several groups of forest-dwelling peoples in Central Africa often called "Pygmies"—a term many consider pejorative. Living in the rainforests of Cameroon, Gabon, Republic of Congo, and Central African Republic, the Baka number around 40,000. They are renowned for their intimate knowledge of the forest ecosystem, sophisticated polyphonic music traditions, and egalitarian social organization. The Baka represent one of humanity's oldest continuous adaptations to tropical rainforest life.</p>

            <h2>Forest Knowledge</h2>
            <p>The Baka possess encyclopedic knowledge of their forest environment developed over millennia. They can identify over 3,000 plant species, knowing which provide food, medicine, construction materials, or poison for hunting arrows. Baka hunters use forest sounds to locate game, read animal tracks and behavior, and construct elaborate traps. Women are expert gatherers, knowing seasonal availability of honey, yams, nuts, and fruits. This knowledge system, transmitted orally through generations, rivals scientific botany in its sophistication and exceeds it in practical forest survival applications.</p>

            <h2>Polyphonic Music</h2>
            <p>Baka music features complex polyphonic singing where multiple independent vocal lines interweave, with individuals spontaneously adding parts to create dense musical textures. This polyphony, recognized by UNESCO, develops naturally as children learn to add their voices to community songs. The music accompanies all aspects of life—hunting preparations, honey gathering, healing ceremonies, and celebrations. Jengi, the forest spirit, is summoned through specific musical rituals. Baka music has influenced contemporary composers and musicians who recognize its sophisticated structures.</p>

            <h2>Egalitarian Society</h2>
            <p>Traditional Baka society is remarkably egalitarian. There are no chiefs—decisions emerge through consensus discussion. Sharing is obligatory; a successful hunter distributes meat throughout the camp rather than keeping it for his family. Individuals who attempt to dominate others face ridicule and social pressure. Men and women have complementary but equally valued roles. This egalitarianism may represent humanity's ancestral social organization before agriculture enabled accumulation and hierarchy. The Baka demonstrate that inequality is not inevitable in human societies.</p>

            <h2>Threats and Discrimination</h2>
            <p>The Baka face severe discrimination from neighboring Bantu-speaking farmers who historically enslaved them and continue treating them as inferior. Logging concessions and national parks have expelled Baka from ancestral forests. Conservation organizations, paradoxically, have sometimes forcibly evicted Baka to create "wilderness" areas, denying that indigenous peoples can coexist with wildlife they've lived alongside for millennia. Advocacy organizations work to secure Baka land rights and challenge discriminatory practices while Baka communities adapt to rapidly changing conditions.</p>
