            <h2>Who Are the Acholi?</h2>
            <p>The Acholi are a Luo-speaking people of northern Uganda and South Sudan, numbering approximately 1.5-2 million primarily in Uganda's Acholi sub-region (Gulu, Kitgum, Pader, and Amuru districts). They speak Acholi, a Western Nilotic language closely related to Lango and other Luo languages. The Acholi are traditionally agropastoralists practicing mixed farming. They became internationally known as victims of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) insurgency (1987-2006), which killed tens of thousands, abducted children, and displaced nearly the entire population into camps.</p>

            <h2>LRA Conflict</h2>
            <p>The Lord's Resistance Army insurgency, led by Joseph Kony, devastated Acholi society for nearly two decades. Beginning in 1987 as rebellion against the Ugandan government, the LRA became infamous for abducting children—perhaps 30,000—and forcing them to fight as soldiers or serve as "wives" to commanders. At the conflict's peak, nearly 90% of Acholi were displaced into camps. Massacres, mutilations, and terror became routine. The conflict displaced more people for longer than any other African war. Its impacts on Acholi society continue through trauma, broken families, and lost generations.</p>

            <h2>Traditional Justice: Mato Oput</h2>
            <p>After the LRA conflict, Acholi communities turned to traditional justice mechanisms, particularly mato oput (drinking of the bitter herb), to reconcile former combatants with their communities. This process, involving acknowledgment of wrongdoing, compensation, and ritual cleansing, offered alternatives to criminal prosecution. International debates arose over whether traditional justice could address LRA atrocities, particularly those committed by child soldiers themselves victims of abduction. The Acholi experience sparked broader discussions about transitional justice, community reconciliation, and the role of indigenous legal systems in post-conflict recovery.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Acholi</h2>
            <p>Modern Acholi are rebuilding after conflict. Most have returned from displacement camps to their villages. Land disputes—arising from camp displacement and destroyed land records—create ongoing tensions. Trauma from the conflict affects mental health across generations. Youth who grew up in camps lack agricultural skills and traditional knowledge. Development programs address infrastructure, education, and livelihoods. Traditional chieftaincy and cultural practices are being revived. How the Acholi recover from one of Africa's most brutal conflicts while preserving cultural identity and rebuilding social fabric defines this resilient people's ongoing reconstruction.</p>
