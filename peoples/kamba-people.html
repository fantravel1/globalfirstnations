            <h2>Who Are the Kamba?</h2>
            <p>The Kamba (Akamba) are a Bantu ethnic group of southeastern Kenya, numbering approximately 4-5 million people, making them Kenya's fifth-largest ethnic group. They speak Kikamba, a Bantu language closely related to Kikuyu. The Kamba inhabit Machakos, Makueni, and Kitui counties in the semi-arid lands east of Nairobi. Historically, the Kamba were renowned long-distance traders who dominated commerce between the Kenyan coast and interior before colonialism. Today they are famous for wood carving, producing most of Kenya's tourist sculptures. The Kamba have contributed significantly to Kenya's military and civil service.</p>

            <h2>Trading Heritage</h2>
            <p>Before colonial rule, the Kamba dominated long-distance trade in East Africa, operating caravans between the Kenyan coast (Mombasa) and interior regions as far as Mount Kenya and Lake Victoria. They traded ivory, slaves, foodstuffs, and manufactured goods, acting as middlemen between coastal Swahili merchants and interior peoples. This commercial role gave the Kamba wide geographic knowledge, diplomatic skills, and exposure to diverse cultures. The arrival of Europeans disrupted these networks, but the trading heritage left cultural marks—the Kamba are known for entrepreneurship and have adapted to various economic niches. Wood carving emerged as a new commercial activity in the 20th century.</p>

            <h2>Wood Carving Industry</h2>
            <p>The Kamba dominate Kenya's wood carving industry, producing the animal figures, masks, and sculptures sold in tourist markets throughout the country. This industry, centered in Wamunyu near Machakos, began in the early 20th century when Mutisya Munge learned carving from a Zaramo craftsman in Tanzania. The craft spread through the community, and today thousands of Kamba families depend on carving. Cooperatives organize production and marketing. Carvers create wildlife figures (especially "Big Five" animals), human figures, abstract sculptures, and utilitarian items. While some lament that this is a commercial rather than "traditional" art, wood carving has become integral to contemporary Kamba identity and economy.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Kamba</h2>
            <p>Modern Kamba face challenges including the semi-arid environment of their homeland, which limits agricultural potential and has driven significant migration to Nairobi and other cities. Despite producing notable political figures (including Kalonzo Musyoka, twice vice president), the Kamba feel politically marginalized compared to larger groups. The community is predominantly Christian, with strong African Independent Church presence (including the Africa Inland Church). Music and dance traditions remain vibrant. Economic activities include farming, livestock, wood carving, and urban employment. How the Kamba leverage their trading heritage and artistic skills while addressing rural development and political representation shapes contemporary community life.</p>
