            <h2>Who Are the Yolngu?</h2>
            <p>The Yolngu are Aboriginal Australian peoples of northeast Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory, numbering approximately 5,000-8,000 people across about 50 clan groups. Speaking Yolngu Matha (a group of related languages), they maintain one of Australia's strongest continuous cultures, having retained their lands and traditions more successfully than many Aboriginal groups. Yolngu are renowned worldwide for their distinctive bark paintings, the didgeridoo (yidaki), and their resistance to assimilation. The 1963 Yirrkala bark petitions, protesting mining on their lands, were pivotal in Australian Aboriginal rights history.</p>

            <h2>Moiety System</h2>
            <p>Yolngu society divides into two moieties: Dhuwa and Yirritja. Everything in the universe—people, land, animals, songs, designs—belongs to one moiety or the other. Marriage must be between moieties; children inherit their father's moiety. Each moiety contains multiple clans with specific totems, ceremonies, and land responsibilities. This system organizes social relationships, ceremonies, and land management. Ceremonial objects, songs, and stories are specific to clans and cannot be shared without permission. The moiety system demonstrates Aboriginal governance's sophistication.</p>

            <h2>Bark Painting</h2>
            <p>Yolngu bark painting represents one of the world's oldest continuous art traditions. Using ochres on eucalyptus bark, artists depict Dreamtime ancestors, sacred sites, and ceremonial designs using distinctive cross-hatching (rarrk). Each clan owns specific designs that encode spiritual knowledge and land relationships. In 1963, Yolngu created the famous bark petitions—formal requests to Parliament incorporating traditional art—pioneering the use of Indigenous culture in legal advocacy. Today, Yolngu art commands high prices in international markets while remaining connected to ceremony and identity.</p>

            <h2>The Yidaki (Didgeridoo)</h2>
            <p>The didgeridoo (yidaki in Yolngu languages) originated in Arnhem Land, traditionally played only by Yolngu and neighboring groups. Made from termite-hollowed eucalyptus branches, the yidaki produces the distinctive drone sound through circular breathing. Traditionally accompanying ceremony and song, the instrument has been appropriated globally—a situation many Yolngu view ambivalently. In traditional contexts, the yidaki remains men's sacred business. Yolngu craftspeople continue making authentic instruments, and debates continue about appropriate use and cultural protocols.</p>

            <h2>Maintaining Law</h2>
            <p>Yolngu distinguish between Balanda (non-Aboriginal) law and Yolngu Rom (law/custom). Rom encompasses governance, ceremony, land management, and social relations established by ancestral beings. The Yolngu have fought to maintain their law alongside Australian law, establishing early homelands movements where communities returned to traditional territories. The 1971 Gove land rights case, though legally unsuccessful, demonstrated Yolngu legal arguments and contributed to eventual land rights legislation. Today, Yolngu continue negotiating between two legal systems.</p>
