            <h2>Who Are the Mansi?</h2>
            <p>The Mansi (historically known as Voguls) are a Uralic people of Western Siberia, inhabiting territories in the northern Ural Mountains and adjacent lowlands of the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug. Numbering approximately 12,000-13,000, they speak Mansi, a Uralic language most closely related to Hungarian—their linguistic ancestors having diverged perhaps 3,000 years ago when the Hungarian ancestors migrated westward. The Mansi developed a taiga-adapted culture combining fishing, hunting, and later reindeer herding. Their bear ceremonies, hero epics, and sacred sites reflect a rich spiritual tradition. Like the related Khanty, the Mansi now face massive disruption from oil and gas extraction on their traditional territories.</p>

            <h2>Uralic Heritage</h2>
            <p>The Mansi and Hungarian languages share a common ancestor from approximately 1000 BCE, when the Proto-Ugric community split. While Hungarian ancestors migrated to the Carpathian Basin, Mansi ancestors remained in the Ural region. Despite 3,000 years of separation, Mansi and Hungarian retain recognizable cognates and grammatical similarities—evidence of deep linguistic connections. Mansi oral traditions describe ancient migrations and interactions with neighboring peoples. Hungarian scholars have long been interested in Mansi as a window into their own prehistoric past. The Mansi themselves occupy a unique position in the Uralic language family, preserving features that illuminate the deep history of these peoples' development across northern Eurasia.</p>

            <h2>Sacred Sites and Ceremonies</h2>
            <p>Mansi maintained an elaborate system of sacred sites throughout their territory. Mountain peaks, forest groves, and riverside locations served as dwelling places for spirits and locations for ceremonies. The World-Watching Man (Mir-susne-khum), a divine figure who observed human affairs from his celestial position, figured prominently in Mansi mythology. Bear ceremonies, similar to Khanty traditions, honored the bear as a sacred being connected to both human and spirit worlds. Hero epics recounted the deeds of legendary figures. Shamans (now largely disappeared) mediated between worlds. Many sacred sites have been damaged or destroyed by industrial development. Some Mansi communities maintain ceremonies at remaining sites, often in secrecy to protect locations from disturbance.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Mansi</h2>
            <p>Modern Mansi live primarily in scattered settlements across the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug. Like Khanty, they face devastating impacts from oil and gas development: pollution, infrastructure construction, and destruction of traditional territories. The Mansi language is critically endangered; perhaps 900-1,000 speakers remain, mostly elderly. Language transmission to children has largely ceased. Some communities maintain traditional activities—fishing, hunting, small-scale reindeer herding—but industrial impacts make this increasingly difficult. Cultural revival efforts include the Mansi language program at Khanty-Mansiysk University and ethnographic documentation. The Dyatlov Pass incident of 1959, in which nine hikers died mysteriously on a mountain sacred to the Mansi, brought unwanted attention; the Mansi were briefly suspected before being cleared. The Mansi face the challenge of maintaining cultural identity while their homeland is transformed by resource extraction.</p>
