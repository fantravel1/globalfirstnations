            <h2>Who Are the Xerente?</h2>
            <p>The Xerente (also Sherénte) are a central Jê-speaking indigenous people of the Brazilian cerrado, living in Tocantins state along tributaries of the Tocantins River. Numbering approximately 4,000-4,500 people, they occupy two demarcated territories totaling about 183,000 hectares. Closely related to the Xavante of Mato Grosso, the Xerente were once part of a larger Xavante-Xerente population that split in the 19th century. They maintain an elaborate clan and moiety system, with patrilineal clans grouped into two exogamous moieties that organize marriage, ceremony, and social life. The Xerente have experienced intensive contact since the colonial period but preserve distinctive cultural practices.</p>

            <h2>Clan System</h2>
            <p>Xerente society is organized around patrilineal clans grouped into two moieties: Doi (associated with the Sun) and Wahirê (associated with the Moon). Each person inherits clan membership from their father, and marriage must occur between moieties. Clans possess distinctive names, body paint patterns, ceremonial roles, and origin narratives. The clan system organizes seating in the men's house, participation in rituals, and social relationships throughout life. While some clan distinctions have weakened with sedentarization and contact, the moiety system remains fundamental to Xerente identity. Children learn their clan affiliation early, and body painting during ceremonies visually distinguishes moiety membership.</p>

            <h2>Historical Contact</h2>
            <p>The Xerente have experienced sustained contact with Brazilian society since the 18th century, making them one of Brazil's longest-contacted indigenous groups. Colonial missions, cattle ranches, and gold mining brought disease, displacement, and population decline. The Tocantins region saw intensive colonization; Xerente territory was repeatedly reduced. Despite these pressures, the Xerente maintained ethnic identity and core cultural features. The 20th century brought FUNAI protection, territorial demarcation, and gradual population recovery. This long contact history distinguishes the Xerente from more recently contacted groups—they have developed strategies for cultural maintenance within ongoing engagement with national society.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Xerente</h2>
            <p>Modern Xerente communities balance traditional practices with integration into regional economy. Agriculture includes traditional crops alongside rice and cattle for market. Many Xerente work in towns near their territory while maintaining village residence. Education in Portuguese and Xerente language supports cultural continuity; universities increasingly enroll Xerente students. Ceremonial life continues, though some rituals have simplified. Political organization combines traditional leadership with formal representation in government indigenous affairs. Challenges include land conflicts with surrounding farmers, environmental degradation of the cerrado, and youth employment. The Xerente demonstrate how indigenous identity can persist through centuries of contact while continuously adapting to changing circumstances.</p>
