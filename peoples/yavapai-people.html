            <h2>Who Are the Yavapai?</h2>
            <p>The Yavapai (Baja in their own language, meaning "people of the sun") are a Yuman-speaking indigenous people of central and western Arizona, traditionally inhabiting a vast territory from the San Francisco Peaks to the Sonoran Desert. They speak Yavapai, a Pai branch language of the Yuman family, related to Havasupai and Hualapai. Before contact, the Yavapai numbered perhaps 4,000-6,000 people organized into four major subdivisions: the Wipukpaya (Northeastern), Tolkepaya (Western), Yavepe (Southeastern), and Kwevkepaya (Southeastern/Verde Valley). Today, three federally recognized tribes—Yavapai-Prescott, Yavapai-Apache Nation, and Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation—have combined populations of approximately 2,500 enrolled members.</p>

            <h2>Arizona's First People</h2>
            <p>Traditional Yavapai territory covered approximately 10 million acres of central Arizona, from the mountains around present-day Flagstaff south to the Sonoran Desert and from the Colorado River east to the Tonto Basin. This vast region provided diverse resources: pine nuts and game from the mountains; saguaro fruit, mesquite beans, and agave from the desert; and deer and small game throughout. The Yavapai were primarily hunter-gatherers, moving seasonally to exploit different ecological zones. Some groups, particularly in the Verde Valley, adopted limited agriculture from neighboring Puebloan peoples. This flexible adaptation to Arizona's diverse environments supported one of the region's most widespread indigenous peoples.</p>

            <h2>Forced March</h2>
            <p>American conquest brought devastating violence to the Yavapai. Mining camps and settlements invaded their territory from the 1860s; conflicts escalated into warfare. The Camp Verde Reservation was established in 1871, but in 1875 the U.S. Army forced approximately 1,500 Yavapai and Apache to walk to the San Carlos Reservation—a distance of 180 miles in winter. Many died during the "Yavapai Trail of Tears." At San Carlos, the Yavapai were held with Apache groups despite distinct cultures and languages, leading to the persistent confusion of Yavapai with Apache. Some families eventually returned to ancestral areas; the Fort McDowell, Prescott, and Camp Verde reservations were eventually established on portions of traditional territory.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Yavapai</h2>
            <p>Modern Yavapai communities have achieved significant economic development. The Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation was instrumental in defending tribal gaming rights in the 1992 federal raid, and now operates the We-Ko-Pa Resort and Fort McDowell Casino. The Yavapai-Prescott Tribe operates the Bucky's and Yavapai Casino. The Yavapai-Apache Nation manages properties in the Verde Valley. Gaming revenue has funded education, health care, housing, and cultural programs. Cultural revitalization includes Yavapai language preservation—the language is endangered but actively taught—and documentation of traditional knowledge and history. The Yavapai demonstrate indigenous recovery from near-destruction to economic success while maintaining cultural identity in a rapidly urbanizing region.</p>
