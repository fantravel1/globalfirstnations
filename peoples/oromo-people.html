            <h2>Who Are the Oromo?</h2>
            <p>The Oromo are the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia and one of the largest in Africa, numbering approximately 40-45 million people (roughly 35% of Ethiopia's population). They speak Oromo (Afaan Oromoo), a Cushitic language written in the Latin script (Qubee). The Oromo inhabit a vast territory called Oromia, stretching from central to southern Ethiopia, encompassing diverse ecological zones from highlands to lowlands. Historically pastoralists and farmers, the Oromo developed the distinctive gadaa democratic governance system. Despite their majority status, the Oromo have historically been politically marginalized in Ethiopia, fueling ongoing demands for greater autonomy and rights.</p>

            <h2>Gadaa System</h2>
            <p>The gadaa is a traditional Oromo system of governance and social organization that UNESCO inscribed as Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2016. Males progress through age-grades, with each grade (of roughly 8 years) having specific roles and responsibilities. Every 8 years, power transfers to the next generation. Leaders (abba gadaa) were chosen through deliberation, not heredity, and their authority was limited. The gadaa assembly (gumi gaayo) made laws and resolved disputes. This system provided checks on power, democratic participation, and generational renewal. While gadaa has weakened under imperial and modern state authority, it persists in some areas and has been revived as a symbol of Oromo heritage and political culture.</p>

            <h2>Marginalization and Resistance</h2>
            <p>The Oromo's incorporation into the Ethiopian state during Menelik II's 19th-century conquests involved military subjugation, land expropriation, and cultural suppression. The Oromo language was banned in education and government for much of the 20th century. Despite comprising the largest population, Oromo faced political exclusion and economic marginalization. This generated Oromo nationalism and, since the 1970s, the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) and other political movements demanding autonomy or independence. Since 2018, Abiy Ahmed (himself Oromo) has led Ethiopia, though his tenure has seen both promises and renewed conflicts. Oromo political consciousness remains strong.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Oromo</h2>
            <p>Modern Oromo navigate complex political terrain. The ascension of Abiy Ahmed initially raised hopes for addressing Oromo grievances, though subsequent conflicts and human rights concerns have disappointed many. Oromia region has seen protests, conflict, and displacement. The Oromo language now has official status in Oromia and growing media presence. Oromo in the diaspora maintain active political engagement and cultural preservation. Coffee, domesticated by ancestors in the Ethiopian highlands, remains important economically and culturally. The Oromo traditional religion (Waaqeffanna) has seen revival alongside Christianity and Islam. How the Oromo achieve political recognition proportionate to their demographic weight shapes Ethiopian politics and Oromo futures.</p>
