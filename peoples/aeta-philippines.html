            <h2>Who Are the Aeta?</h2>
            <p>The **Aeta** (also Agta, Ati, Ata, and other local names) are among the earliest inhabitants of the Philippines, arriving perhaps **30,000 years ago** via land bridges during the last Ice Age. Belonging to a broader group called **Negritos** (a Spanish colonial term now considered problematic) due to their dark skin and curly hair, the Aeta are genetically and culturally distinct from later Austronesian migrants who now form the majority Filipino population. Today numbering approximately **30,000-50,000** across scattered communities in Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao, the Aeta traditionally lived as nomadic hunter-gatherers in rainforests, developing extraordinary botanical and environmental knowledge. Centuries of marginalization have pushed them to highland regions as lowlands were settled, and they face ongoing challenges of land loss, discrimination, and cultural erosion.</p>

            <h2>Rainforest Knowledge</h2>
            <p>The Aeta developed intimate knowledge of Philippine rainforest ecosystems over millennia. They identified hundreds of plant species for food, medicine, construction, and tools. Hunting skills—using bows, traps, and detailed understanding of animal behavior—enabled them to harvest game sustainably. Women gathered roots, fruits, and honey while men hunted. Seasonal movements followed resource availability; temporary camps left minimal environmental impact. This **traditional ecological knowledge** represents irreplaceable intellectual heritage. Studies show Aeta botanical knowledge rivals or exceeds that of university-trained biologists for their regions. As forests are destroyed and Aeta communities settled, this knowledge faces extinction. Conservation organizations increasingly recognize Aeta expertise, partnering with communities for forest management, though such collaborations remain limited.</p>

            <h2>Mount Pinatubo Disaster</h2>
            <p>The 1991 eruption of **Mount Pinatubo**—one of the 20th century's largest volcanic events—devastated Aeta communities living on and around the mountain. Perhaps 20,000 Aeta were displaced; hundreds died in the eruption and its aftermath. Lahars (volcanic mudflows) destroyed villages and ancestral lands. Many Aeta were relocated to lowland resettlement sites—unfamiliar environments where their forest skills were useless and where they faced discrimination from neighboring communities. Decades later, many remain in resettlements, struggling with poverty, health problems, and cultural dislocation. Some have returned to Pinatubo's slopes as vegetation recovers, rebuilding communities. The disaster exemplifies how natural hazards disproportionately impact already marginalized indigenous peoples, and how recovery can perpetuate displacement when it fails to account for cultural needs.</p>

            <h2>Discrimination and Resilience</h2>
            <p>The Aeta face pervasive discrimination in Philippine society. Historical prejudice viewed them as primitive, inferior, or subhuman—attitudes that persist in casual racism, limited educational and employment opportunities, and exclusion from mainstream society. Land rights are poorly protected; Aeta ancestral territories have been appropriated for agriculture, logging, mining, and tourism with minimal compensation. Legal recognition through the **Indigenous Peoples Rights Act** (1997) provides some protection, but enforcement is weak. Despite marginalization, Aeta communities demonstrate resilience: advocacy organizations assert rights; cultural programs preserve traditions; some communities have developed sustainable livelihoods including eco-tourism and forest product harvesting; and young Aeta increasingly access education while maintaining identity. Their survival as a people, against centuries of pressure, testifies to cultural strength.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Challenges</h2>
            <p>The Aeta face interlinked challenges threatening cultural survival. **Deforestation** destroys the ecosystems that sustained traditional life. **Land loss** to settlers, corporations, and government projects displaces communities. **Poverty** forces dependence on casual labor and charity. **Health disparities** including high rates of tuberculosis reflect limited healthcare access. **Educational barriers** perpetuate marginalization. **Climate change** intensifies typhoons and droughts affecting forest resources. Yet responses are emerging: indigenous schools teach in Aeta languages; land title campaigns secure territorial rights; health programs address specific community needs; and cultural festivals celebrate heritage. Whether these efforts can reverse centuries of marginalization depends on broader Philippine society recognizing Aeta rights and contributions—their ancient knowledge systems, their environmental stewardship, their human dignity as the islands' first peoples.</p>
