            <h2>Who Are the Ainu?</h2>
            <p>The Ainu are the indigenous people of Japan, historically inhabiting Hokkaido, the Kuril Islands, Sakhalin, and northern Honshu. Today, approximately 25,000 people identify as Ainu, though estimates of those with Ainu ancestry range much higher. The Ainu language, unrelated to Japanese or any other known language family, is critically endangered with only a handful of elderly native speakers remaining. Long marginalized and subjected to assimilation policies, the Ainu were finally recognized as Japan's indigenous people in 2019, a landmark acknowledgment that opened new possibilities for cultural preservation.</p>

            <h2>Origins and Language</h2>
            <p>Ainu origins remain debated. They may descend from ancient Jomon populations who inhabited Japan before Yayoi migration. The Ainu language (Ainu itak) is a language isolate—unrelated to Japanese, Korean, or any other known language. It lacks a traditional writing system; oral literature was preserved through yukar (epic poems) recited over hours or days. Missionaries developed romanized transcription in the 19th century. Today, with fluent speakers nearly gone, intensive documentation and teaching efforts work against time to preserve this unique linguistic heritage.</p>

            <h2>Spiritual World</h2>
            <p>Traditional Ainu spirituality centers on kamuy—spirits inhabiting natural phenomena, animals, and objects. Bears held special significance; the iomante ceremony involved raising a bear cub before ritually sacrificing it to release its spirit to the kamuy world, bearing gifts and messages. Japanese authorities banned iomante in 1955 as cruel, though Ainu understood it as honoring the bear. The concept of sending spirits back with gratitude pervaded Ainu relations with nature. While few practice traditional religion today, kamuy beliefs inform contemporary Ainu identity and environmental values.</p>

            <h2>Colonization and Assimilation</h2>
            <p>Japanese colonization of Hokkaido accelerated after the Meiji Restoration (1868). The 1899 "Former Aborigines Protection Act" stripped Ainu of land, banned practices including tattoos and earrings, and mandated Japanese education. Ainu were forced into agriculture despite traditional hunter-gatherer-fisher economy. Children were forbidden from speaking Ainu; cultural practices were prohibited or suppressed. The term "former aborigines" implied Ainu were disappearing. This law remained until 1997, when a new act recognized Ainu culture but still denied indigenous status—that recognition came only in 2019.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Revival</h2>
            <p>Ainu cultural revival has accelerated since the 1980s. The Upopoy National Ainu Museum, opened in 2020, represents a major governmental investment in Ainu heritage. Language classes, though challenging given speaker scarcity, continue. Traditional crafts—including embroidered robes with distinctive patterns—are being preserved and adapted. Ainu artists and activists have gained visibility, challenging stereotypes. Yet challenges remain: many Ainu hide their identity due to persistent discrimination, land rights are not addressed, and economic disadvantages persist. Recognition was a beginning, not an endpoint.</p>
