            <h2>Who Are the Ainu?</h2>
            <p>The Ainu are the indigenous people of Japan, historically inhabiting Hokkaido, the Kuril Islands, Sakhalin, and northern Honshu. Today, approximately 25,000-200,000 people claim Ainu descent (estimates vary widely due to historical assimilation and stigma), primarily in Hokkaido. They speak Ainu, a language isolate unrelated to Japanese—now critically endangered with only a handful of native speakers. The Ainu's origins remain debated; they may descend from Jōmon people who inhabited Japan before Yayoi (proto-Japanese) migration. Japan only recognized Ainu as indigenous people in 2019, ending a long history of denial and assimilation policies.</p>

            <h2>Culture and Beliefs</h2>
            <p>Traditional Ainu culture was based on hunting, fishing, and gathering in Hokkaido's forests and coasts. Their religion centered on kamuy—spirits inhabiting natural phenomena (fire, water, animals, mountains). The bear ceremony (Iyomante) was most sacred: a bear cub was raised in the village, then ritually killed to release its kamuy to the spirit world. Ainu women practiced distinctive facial tattooing around the mouth. Oral literature (yukar epic poetry, uwepeker tales) preserved history and mythology. Distinctive crafts include attush (bark fiber cloth), wood carving, and embroidered robes. These practices largely disappeared under assimilation but are now being revived.</p>

            <h2>Colonization and Assimilation</h2>
            <p>Japanese expansion into Hokkaido intensified in the Meiji era (1868+). The 1899 "Former Aborigines Protection Act" dispossessed Ainu of land, banned traditional practices, and forced assimilation—Ainu language in schools was prohibited; Japanese names required. Ainu became second-class citizens facing discrimination. The Japanese government long denied indigenous status, claiming Japan was homogeneous. Only in 2008 did parliament recognize Ainu as indigenous; the 2019 Ainu Policy Promotion Act finally provided legal protection. This belated recognition followed decades of Ainu activism demanding rights and cultural preservation.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Revival</h2>
            <p>Modern Ainu cultural revival accelerates. The Upopoy National Ainu Museum and Park (opened 2020) in Hokkaido presents Ainu culture to Japanese and international visitors. Language programs teach Ainu, though fluent speakers are extremely few. Traditional crafts, music, and dance are performed and taught. Ainu musicians blend traditional and contemporary styles. Yet challenges remain: discrimination persists; many Ainu hide ancestry; economic disparities continue; and whether revival can create a living culture versus museum heritage is debated. How Ainu reclaim identity in modern Japan, and whether Japan genuinely embraces its indigenous heritage, shapes the future.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Issues</h2>
            <p>The Ainu face ongoing challenges. Many people of Ainu descent remain unaware of their heritage or conceal it due to discrimination. Intermarriage and assimilation have made "pure Ainu" identity contested and arguably irrelevant—cultural identification matters more. Land rights remain unresolved; Ainu lost territories without treaties or compensation. Economic disparities between Ainu and Japanese persist. The 2019 law provides support but critics argue it lacks teeth—no self-governance provisions, no apology for historical injustice. Ainu activists continue pressing for stronger recognition, land rights, and meaningful cultural autonomy within Japanese society.</p>
