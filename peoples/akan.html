            <h2>Who Are the Akan?</h2>
            <p>The Akan are a meta-ethnic group comprising approximately 20 million people primarily in Ghana (47.5% of population) and Ivory Coast, making them one of Africa's largest cultural groups. Major Akan subgroups include the Ashanti (Asante), Fante, Akuapem, Akyem, Bono, Nzema, Baoulé, and Anyi. United by the Akan language family and shared cultural traditions including matrilineal descent, gold-working mastery, kente cloth weaving, and the sacred Golden Stool, the Akan established some of West Africa's most powerful kingdoms. Their influence extends globally through the African diaspora, with Akan naming traditions, religious concepts (Nyame, Anansi), and cultural practices surviving in the Caribbean and Americas.</p>

            <h2>Gold, Power, and the Ashanti Empire</h2>
            <p>The Akan homeland sits atop some of the world's richest gold deposits, and gold has shaped their civilization for millennia. The **Ashanti Empire** (1670-1902), the most powerful Akan state, accumulated legendary wealth through gold mining and trade. The empire's symbol, the **Golden Stool** (Sika Dwa Kofi), is believed to contain the soul of the Ashanti nation—it has never been sat upon, even by the king (Asantehene). When the British demanded the stool in 1900, it sparked the War of the Golden Stool. The stool remains sacred today, appearing only at major ceremonies. Akan gold weights (abrammuo), used to measure gold dust currency, represent one of Africa's most sophisticated systems of standardized weights, with each weight encoding proverbs and cultural knowledge.</p>

            <h2>Kente Cloth and Adinkra Symbols</h2>
            <p>**Kente** cloth, originally reserved for Akan royalty, has become globally recognized as a symbol of African heritage. Woven on traditional looms in narrow strips then sewn together, each pattern carries specific meaning: Sika Futuro (gold dust) signifies wealth, Oyokoman represents political authority, and Adwinasa ("all motifs exhausted") indicates the weaver's mastery. **Adinkra** symbols, traditionally stamped on mourning cloth, encode Akan philosophy: Gye Nyame ("except for God") represents divine supremacy, Sankofa (a bird looking backward) means learning from the past, and Dwennimmen (ram's horns) symbolizes humility with strength. These symbols now appear globally on everything from academic regalia to corporate logos, spreading Akan visual philosophy worldwide.</p>

            <h2>Matrilineal Society and Akan Religion</h2>
            <p>The Akan practice **matrilineal descent** (abusua), meaning inheritance, succession, and family identity pass through the mother's line—unusual in Africa. A man's heirs are his sister's children, not his own. This system grants Akan women significant social power while men hold most political offices. Traditional Akan religion centers on **Nyame** (supreme creator god), **Asase Yaa** (earth goddess), and lesser deities (abosom) associated with rivers, mountains, and ancestors. The **Akom** priest/priestess communicates with spirits through possession-dancing. The trickster spider **Anansi**, keeper of all stories, traveled to the Caribbean with enslaved Akan people, becoming central to Jamaican and African American folklore. Today, most Akan are Christian (particularly Methodist and Catholic) or Muslim, but traditional beliefs persist alongside world religions.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Akan Culture</h2>
            <p>Modern Akan society maintains traditional institutions while adapting to contemporary life. The Asantehene (Ashanti king), currently Otumfuo Osei Tutu II, remains enormously influential, presiding over the Ashanti Kingdom within Ghana's democratic system. Elaborate funerals (ayie) lasting days, featuring fantasy coffins carved as cars, fish, or other symbols of the deceased's life, showcase Akan artistry and beliefs about death as transition rather than ending. **Akan day names** (Kwame for Saturday-born males, Adjoa for Monday-born females) remain common—Ghana's first president Kwame Nkrumah bore his Saturday name. Challenges include tensions between traditional and modern legal systems, particularly regarding land rights and chieftaincy disputes, while Akan cultural exports from kente to Anansi stories continue gaining global recognition.</p>
