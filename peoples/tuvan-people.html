            <h2>Who Are the Tuvan?</h2>
            <p>The Tuvan (or Tuvans) are a Turkic-speaking people inhabiting the Tuva Republic in southern Siberia, between Mongolia and Russia proper. Numbering approximately 280,000, they speak Tuvan, a Siberian Turkic language. Tuva occupies a unique geographic and cultural position at the heart of Asia, where the Siberian taiga meets the Central Asian steppe, creating diverse environments from mountain forests to semi-arid grasslands. The Tuvan are internationally renowned for khoomei (throat singing), a remarkable vocal tradition in which a single singer produces multiple simultaneous pitches. Their culture blends Turkic nomadic traditions, Tibetan Buddhist influences, and indigenous shamanic practices.</p>

            <h2>Nomadic Pastoralism</h2>
            <p>Traditional Tuvan economy was based on nomadic pastoralism—herding horses, cattle, sheep, goats, yaks, and camels according to the varied terrain. Families moved seasonally between winter camps in sheltered valleys and summer pastures on mountain slopes and steppes. The yurt (ger) provided portable shelter. Horse culture was central; Tuvans bred excellent horses and horsemanship was highly valued. Hunting supplemented herding, with significant elk, deer, and wild boar populations. Mountain-dwelling Tuvan groups (Todja Tuvan) combined reindeer herding with taiga hunting, representing a different adaptation within Tuvan culture. This pastoral economy continued through the Soviet period, though collectivized, and persists today alongside settled life.</p>

            <h2>Throat Singing (Khoomei)</h2>
            <p>Tuvan throat singing has gained international fame. This technique allows a single vocalist to produce two or more distinct pitches simultaneously—a fundamental tone and overtone melodies created through precise manipulation of the vocal tract. Different styles (sygyt, khoomei, kargyraa, and others) create varied sonic textures. Throat singing developed from the Tuvan relationship with nature—the sound of wind, water, and animals integrated into human vocalization. Traditionally performed by herders while alone on the steppe, throat singing has become a symbol of Tuvan identity. Groups like Huun-Huur-Tu have achieved international recognition, and throat singing festivals attract musicians and enthusiasts worldwide. UNESCO recognized Tuvan throat singing as Intangible Cultural Heritage.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Tuvan</h2>
            <p>Modern Tuva maintains strong cultural identity. The Tuvan language is relatively vital, spoken by most ethnic Tuvans and used in schools, media, and government. Both shamanism and Tibetan Buddhism, suppressed during the Soviet period, have revived and coexist. Traditional pastoralism continues, though many Tuvans now live in the capital Kyzyl. Throat singing has become both a source of cultural pride and economic opportunity through tourism and international performance. The Tuva Republic has significant autonomy within Russia, though economic development lags. Archaeological sites in Tuva, including spectacular Scythian-era burials, attract scholarly attention. Environmental challenges include overgrazing and mining impacts. The Tuvan demonstrate how indigenous identity can be maintained and even strengthened through distinctive cultural expressions like throat singing.</p>
