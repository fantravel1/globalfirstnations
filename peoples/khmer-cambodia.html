            <h2>Who Are the Khmer People?</h2>
            <p>The Khmer are the dominant ethnic group of Cambodia, comprising approximately 97% of its 16 million population, with additional communities in Thailand (Northern Khmer) and Vietnam (Khmer Krom). The Khmer built one of history's greatest civilizations—the Angkor Empire (802-1431)—whose temple complexes remain among humanity's architectural achievements. After Angkor's decline, Cambodia became squeezed between expanding Thai and Vietnamese powers. The 20th century brought French colonialism, independence, the Khmer Rouge genocide (1975-1979) that killed 2 million people, and ongoing recovery. Khmer identity is inseparable from this dramatic history.</p>

            <h2>Angkor's Glory</h2>
            <p>The Angkor Empire represented one of Southeast Asia's most sophisticated civilizations. At its height (12th-13th centuries), Angkor was among the world's largest cities, with perhaps one million residents and an elaborate water management system. Angkor Wat, built by Suryavarman II, remains the world's largest religious monument—originally Hindu, later Buddhist. Temple complexes like Bayon featured massive face towers; Ta Prohm's jungle-embraced ruins became globally famous. This architectural and engineering achievement defines Khmer identity—modern Cambodians see themselves as inheritors of Angkorian glory, a source of pride amid subsequent decline.</p>

            <h2>Classical Dance</h2>
            <p>Classical Khmer dance (Robam Boran) represents the living continuation of Angkorian court traditions. Dancers in elaborate costumes and golden headdresses perform movements derived from temple bas-reliefs depicting apsaras (celestial dancers). The curved-back hand gestures, slow precision movements, and codified vocabulary of poses connect modern performers to millennium-old aesthetics. The Khmer Rouge specifically targeted dancers; only a handful survived to transmit traditions. Post-genocide revival has restored major dance forms, now UNESCO-recognized Intangible Heritage. Dance represents both artistic achievement and cultural survival against attempted destruction.</p>

            <h2>The Khmer Rouge</h2>
            <p>The Khmer Rouge regime (1975-1979) under Pol Pot implemented radical agrarian communism, evacuating cities, abolishing money, banning religion, and systematically murdering perceived enemies—intellectuals, professionals, minorities, and anyone suspect. Approximately 2 million died—roughly one-quarter of Cambodia's population—through execution, starvation, and disease. This genocide traumatized Cambodian society; the generation of educated leaders was largely eliminated. Ongoing Khmer Rouge tribunal proceedings address some crimes, but trauma persists. Recovery—economic, institutional, psychological—defines contemporary Cambodia decades later.</p>

            <h2>Buddhism Today</h2>
            <p>Theravada Buddhism structures Khmer life. Before the Khmer Rouge, virtually all men spent time as monks; pagodas anchored village life. The regime killed monks and destroyed temples. Since 1979, Buddhism has revived dramatically—pagodas rebuilt, monastic education restored, festivals resumed. The sangha (monastic community) regained social influence, though some criticize political entanglement. Buddhist concepts of karma, merit, and rebirth shape Khmer worldviews. Major festivals like Pchum Ben (ancestor veneration) and Khmer New Year (Chaul Chnam Thmey) mobilize national celebration. Buddhism provides continuity linking contemporary Cambodians to Angkorian civilization and community identity after genocide's rupture.</p>
