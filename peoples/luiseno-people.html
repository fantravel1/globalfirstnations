            <h2>Who Are the Luiseño?</h2>
            <p>The Luiseño (Payómkawichum in their own language) are an indigenous people of Southern California, traditionally inhabiting coastal and inland areas of what are now San Diego and Riverside counties. The name "Luiseño" comes from Mission San Luis Rey de Francia, where many were missionized during the Spanish colonial period. Before contact, the Luiseño numbered perhaps 10,000 people living in numerous autonomous villages. They speak a Takic language of the Uto-Aztecan family, related to other Southern California indigenous languages. Today, several federally recognized Luiseño tribes—including Pala, Pauma-Yuima, La Jolla, Rincon, Pechanga, and Soboba—have combined enrolled populations of approximately 5,000-7,000 members.</p>

            <h2>Traditional Lifeways</h2>
            <p>Traditional Luiseño territory extended from the Pacific coast to the inland valleys and mountains, encompassing diverse ecosystems that supported a varied subsistence economy. Acorns from coast live oaks were the dietary staple, processed into flour using mortars and pestles, many of which remain visible as bedrock mortars at village sites. Coastal groups harvested shellfish and sea mammals; inland groups hunted deer, rabbits, and small game. Plant foods including seeds, berries, roots, and agave supplemented the diet. Villages were politically autonomous, each with hereditary leadership, but participated in regional ceremonial and exchange networks. The Chinigchinich religion, centered on puberty initiations and the use of toloache (jimsonweed), spread among the Luiseño and neighboring groups in the centuries before contact.</p>

            <h2>Mission Period</h2>
            <p>Spanish colonization profoundly impacted the Luiseño. Mission San Luis Rey (founded 1798) and Mission San Juan Capistrano (1776) incorporated Luiseño people into the mission system, disrupting traditional life while introducing new technologies, crops, and livestock. Missionization brought epidemic disease, forced labor, and cultural suppression. After Mexican secularization of missions (1833) and American conquest (1848), Luiseño lands were largely taken by ranchers and settlers. The Luiseño survived through adaptation, maintaining communities despite land loss. In 1875, President Grant established several small reservations for Luiseño and neighboring "Mission Indians." These reservations remain the basis of contemporary Luiseño tribal lands.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Luiseño</h2>
            <p>Modern Luiseño tribes have achieved significant economic development, particularly through gaming enterprises. The Pechanga Resort Casino is one of California's largest, providing substantial tribal revenue and employment. Other Luiseño tribes operate casinos of varying sizes. Gaming revenue has funded housing, education, health care, and cultural programs. Cultural revitalization includes language preservation efforts—Luiseño is severely endangered but taught in tribal programs—and the continuation of bird singing, ceremonial practices, and basket weaving traditions. The Luiseño maintain connections to ancestral landscapes, including successful repatriation of sacred sites and ancestral remains. Contemporary Luiseño identity balances cultural preservation with participation in modern California society.</p>
