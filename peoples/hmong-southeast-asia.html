            <h2>Who Are the Hmong?</h2>
            <p>The Hmong are a highland ethnic group originating in southern China, now spread across Southeast Asia and the global diaspora. Approximately 12 million Hmong live worldwide, with the largest populations in China (9 million, where they are called Miao, though this term encompasses related but distinct groups), Vietnam (1.4 million), Laos (600,000), Thailand (200,000), and the United States (330,000). The Hmong language belongs to the Hmong-Mien family. Their history is marked by resistance to lowland states, highland agriculture, and dramatic displacement—particularly from Laos after the Secret War.</p>

            <h2>Highland Agriculture</h2>
            <p>Traditionally, Hmong practiced swidden (slash-and-burn) agriculture in high mountain areas where lowland rice cultivation was impossible. They grew dry rice, corn, and vegetables, rotating fields as soil depleted. This mobile agricultural system required periodic village relocation and kept Hmong on the margins of lowland states. Opium cultivation became significant under French colonial encouragement. Government bans on swidden agriculture and opium have forced transitions to settled farming, with consequences for traditional land use patterns and economic independence.</p>

            <h2>The Secret War</h2>
            <p>During the Vietnam War era, the CIA recruited Hmong in Laos to fight communist Pathet Lao forces—the "Secret War" (1964-1975). General Vang Pao led a Hmong army of 40,000; proportionally, Hmong suffered more casualties than any American ally. When the US withdrew and communists took Laos in 1975, Hmong faced persecution as collaborators. Hundreds of thousands fled across the Mekong to Thai refugee camps; many eventually resettled in the US, France, and Australia. This war and displacement defines modern Hmong diaspora identity.</p>

            <h2>Paj Ntaub and Craft</h2>
            <p>Paj ntaub (flower cloth) is the Hmong textile tradition—intricate embroidery, appliqué, and batik creating geometric patterns and symbolic designs. Traditionally, girls learned these skills young, creating elaborate clothes demonstrating marriageability. Story cloths, developed in refugee camps, depict narrative scenes of Hmong life, war, and migration. Paj ntaub has become both cultural preservation and economic activity for diaspora women. The technical complexity and cultural meaning embedded in these textiles represent Hmong identity transmitted across generations despite displacement.</p>

            <h2>Diaspora Communities</h2>
            <p>American Hmong communities, concentrated in California, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, navigate cultural preservation amid American integration. Clan structures remain important; New Year celebrations draw thousands. Generational tensions arise between elders maintaining traditional practices and youth adapted to American life. Educational achievement has risen dramatically since initial refugee settlement, yet economic disparities persist. Shamanic practice (txiv neeb) continues alongside Christianity (many Hmong converted through missionary contact). The community produces artists, writers, and politicians while grappling with preserving heritage.</p>
