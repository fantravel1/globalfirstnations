            <h2>Who Are the Shina?</h2>
            <p>The Shina are a Dardic ethnic group inhabiting the valleys of Gilgit-Baltistan and adjacent areas of Pakistan and India, numbering approximately 500,000-700,000. They speak Shina, a Dardic language of the Indo-Aryan family with several distinct dialects. The Shina are concentrated in Gilgit District, Astore, Chilas, and parts of Kohistan, living in the spectacular mountain valleys where the Karakoram, Himalaya, and Hindu Kush ranges converge. This is home to some of Earth's highest peaks, including K2 and Nanga Parbat. The Shina are predominantly Shia Muslims with some Sunni and Ismaili communities, and their mountain homeland places them at the geopolitical intersection of Pakistan, India, and China.</p>

            <h2>Mountain Agriculture</h2>
            <p>The Shina developed intensive mountain agriculture in the narrow valleys carved between massive peaks. Terraced fields, irrigated by elaborate channel systems fed by glacier melt, produce wheat, maize, and vegetables during the short growing season. Orchards of apricots (the region is famous for its dried apricots), apples, and other fruit provide nutrition and trade goods. Livestock—goats, sheep, and cattle—graze on high pastures in summer. This agricultural system, developed over centuries, maximizes production in an environment where arable land is scarce and growing seasons short. Climate change now affects glacier-fed irrigation, threatening traditional livelihoods.</p>

            <h2>Rock Art and Petroglyphs</h2>
            <p>The Gilgit-Baltistan region contains one of the world's richest collections of rock art—thousands of petroglyphs and inscriptions carved on boulders along ancient trade routes. Dating from prehistoric times through the Buddhist period and into the Islamic era, these carvings include animals, hunting scenes, religious symbols, and inscriptions in multiple scripts. Sites like Chilas Bridge and the Sacred Rock of Hunza document millennia of human presence and cultural change. Some represent the Shina's pre-Islamic past; others record travelers on the ancient Silk Road routes. This rock art heritage connects contemporary Shina to deep historical layers in their mountain homeland.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Shina</h2>
            <p>Modern Shina navigate between traditional mountain life and connection to the wider world via the Karakoram Highway—the engineering marvel linking Pakistan to China. This road has transformed the region, bringing goods, tourists, and new opportunities while eroding isolation. Gilgit town has grown substantially. Education has expanded; many Shina work in government, tourism, and services. The Shina language remains vital though facing pressure from Urdu. Gilgit-Baltistan's disputed political status (between Pakistani and Indian Kashmir claims) creates uncertainty. How the Shina preserve cultural identity while benefiting from the Karakoram Highway's connectivity shapes this mountain people's rapidly changing future.</p>
