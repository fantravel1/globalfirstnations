            <h2>Who Are the Bajo?</h2>
            <p>The Bajo (also spelled Bajau or Bajao) are one of the world's few remaining sea nomad peoples, traditionally living their entire lives on houseboats throughout the waters of the Coral Triangle—the seas between Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Often called "Sea Gypsies," these maritime people have developed extraordinary physiological adaptations and cultural practices centered entirely on the ocean.</p>
            <p>Historians believe the Bajo originated in the Philippines before spreading throughout Southeast Asian waters over centuries. Without land or citizenship ties to any nation, they have long lived on the margins of society, their identity bound not to territory but to the sea itself.</p>

            <h2>Life on the Water</h2>
            <p>Traditional Bajo live on lepa-lepa—wooden houseboats that serve as homes for entire families. These boats, measuring typically 5-10 meters long, contain living quarters, cooking areas, and storage for fishing equipment. Families might spend months at sea, coming to shore only to trade fish for rice and other necessities, or to shelter from storms.</p>
            <p>Children learn to swim before they can walk, and grow up more comfortable in water than on land. Many traditional Bajo experience motion sickness and disorientation on dry ground—a condition they call "land-sickness." The sea provides everything: food, transportation, livelihood, and identity.</p>

            <h2>Remarkable Adaptations</h2>
            <p>Scientific studies have revealed that Bajo have evolved genuine physiological adaptations for diving. Their spleens are approximately 50% larger than those of neighboring land-dwelling populations—an adaptation that allows for greater oxygen storage. Research published in the journal Cell found this represents genetic selection, not just individual training.</p>
            <p>Skilled Bajo divers can descend to depths exceeding 70 meters and hold their breath for over five minutes while spearfishing or collecting sea cucumbers. They hunt using traditional methods including hand-made spears, without modern equipment. Some deliberately rupture their eardrums in youth to reduce pressure pain during deep dives.</p>

            <h2>Spiritual Connection to the Sea</h2>
            <p>Traditional Bajo spirituality centers on sea spirits and ancestors. The omboh, or spirit medium, communicates with ocean deities to ensure good catches and safe passage. Before major fishing expeditions, ceremonies seek blessings and protection. The spirits of deceased relatives are believed to watch over living family members at sea.</p>
            <p>Many Bajo communities practice a form of Islam combined with animist beliefs. They maintain sacred sites on specific islands and reefs where spirits are believed to dwell. The annual Regatta Lepa festival celebrates Bajo heritage with decorated boat processions, traditional dances, and competitions.</p>

            <h2>Challenges and Change</h2>
            <p>Modern pressures threaten the Bajo way of life. National governments have attempted to settle sea nomads on land, creating stilt village communities. Declining fish stocks, marine pollution, and restrictions on traditional fishing areas force many Bajo to abandon their maritime lifestyle. Without citizenship, many lack access to education and healthcare.</p>
            <p>Younger generations increasingly move to cities for wage employment, and the knowledge of boat-building, navigation, and traditional fishing techniques risks being lost. Conservation efforts sometimes conflict with Bajo subsistence practices, though some communities now partner with marine protection programs.</p>
