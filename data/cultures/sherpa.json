    "introduction": {
      "whoTheyAre": "The Sherpa are an ethnic group native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal, primarily concentrated in the Khumbu region below Mount Everest. Renowned worldwide for their mountaineering skills and high-altitude expertise, the Sherpa have become synonymous with Himalayan climbing expeditions. Beyond mountaineering, the Sherpa are a vibrant community with rich Tibetan Buddhist traditions, distinctive language, and centuries-old mountain agriculture and yak herding practices. They possess unique physiological adaptations to high altitude that have made them invaluable partners in Himalayan exploration.",
      "culturalIdentity": "Sherpa culture is deeply intertwined with Tibetan Buddhism, the mountain environment, and values of community cooperation. Monasteries and prayer flags dot the landscape. Sherpa practice polyandry (one woman marrying multiple brothers) to keep land holdings intact. Their name 'Sherpa' comes from Tibetan words meaning 'people from the east.' Despite global fame as mountaineers, most Sherpa continue traditional livelihoods of farming and yak herding, with mountaineering providing supplementary income for some families.",
      "funFact": "Sherpa people have genetic adaptations that help them thrive at extreme altitudes where others struggle - their bodies produce more hemoglobin and use oxygen more efficiently, making them natural mountaineers!"
    },
    "history": {
      "origins": "The Sherpa migrated from eastern Tibet to Nepal around 500 years ago, settling in the high Himalayan valleys. They brought Tibetan Buddhist practices, language, and agricultural techniques adapted to mountain environments. The name 'Sherpa' derives from 'shar' (east) and 'pa' (people).",
      "mountaineeringHistory": "Sherpa involvement in mountaineering began in the early 20th century when European expeditions hired them as porters. Tenzing Norgay's summiting of Everest with Edmund Hillary in 1953 brought global recognition. Since then, Sherpa have been integral to Himalayan expeditions, often reaching summits multiple times while supporting climbers.",
      "modernDevelopment": "Tourism and mountaineering have transformed Sherpa economy and society. The Khumbu region sees thousands of trekkers annually. This brings income but also environmental and cultural challenges. Many Sherpa have received education and moved to cities, though strong cultural ties remain.",
      "tragedies": "Sherpa mountaineers face enormous risks. Notable tragedies include the 2014 Everest avalanche killing 16 Sherpa and the 2015 earthquake triggering avalanches. These events have sparked discussions about Sherpa safety, compensation, and the ethics of commercial mountaineering."
    },
    "culture": {
      "tibetanBuddhism": "Sherpa practice Tibetan Buddhism (Nyingma school). Monasteries like Tengboche are spiritual and community centers. Prayer wheels, mani stones, and prayer flags are ubiquitous. Lamas perform rituals for births, deaths, and journeys. The Mani Rimdu festival features masked dances and Buddhist teachings.",
      "agriculture": "Traditional Sherpa livelihood combines agriculture and animal husbandry adapted to high altitudes. They grow potatoes, barley, and buckwheat in terraced fields. Yaks provide meat, milk, wool, and transportation. Seasonal migration between lower winter settlements and higher summer pastures follows ancient patterns.",
      "mountaineeringCulture": "Sherpa mountaineering expertise is legendary. They carry heavy loads, fix ropes, establish camps, and rescue climbers at extreme altitudes. Many Sherpa have summited Everest dozens of times. Apa Sherpa and Kami Rita hold records with over 20 summits each. This work is dangerous but provides crucial income.",
      "socialStructure": "Sherpa society emphasizes community cooperation. Nawa (rotating community work) ensures collective tasks are completed. Polyandry (multiple brothers marrying one woman) traditionally kept land undivided. Gender relations are relatively egalitarian. Clan identity and family networks remain strong.",
      "hospitality": "Sherpa hospitality is renowned. Teahouses and lodges along trekking routes welcome travelers. Sharing food and shelter, particularly chang (barley beer) and tea, builds relationships. Generosity toward guests is a core value.",
      "festivals": "Major festivals include Losar (Tibetan New Year) with prayers, dancing, and feasting; Mani Rimdu at monasteries with masked dances; and Dumji celebrating Guru Rinpoche. These events strengthen community bonds and religious devotion."
