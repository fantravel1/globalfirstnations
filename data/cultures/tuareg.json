Known as 'Blue People' for their indigo-dyed clothing that stains their skin, Tuareg society is notably matrilineal with women holding property rights and men wearing face veils. Traditionally controlling trans-Saharan trade routes and conducting salt caravans, the Tuareg maintain distinct cultural identity while facing challenges from drought, political instability, and sedentarization pressures."}},
