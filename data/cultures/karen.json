    "introduction": {
      "whoTheyAre": "The Karen (also Kayin) are one of Southeast Asia's largest ethnic minorities, primarily inhabiting the mountainous borderlands between Myanmar (Burma) and Thailand. Comprising various subgroups including S'gaw, Pwo, and Kayan (known for neck coils), the Karen have maintained distinct cultural identities despite centuries of external pressures. They are renowned for their intricate weaving, agricultural knowledge, and strong community bonds. The Kayan women's brass neck rings have become iconic, though this practice represents only one small Karen subgroup.",
      "culturalIdentity": "Karen culture emphasizes community harmony, respect for nature, and preservation of traditional knowledge. Their woven textiles featuring distinctive patterns are worn with pride and carry cultural meanings. Many Karen practice animism, Christianity (introduced by missionaries), or a blend of both. Traditional Karen society was egalitarian with village elders providing leadership. Music, particularly drum and gong ensembles, plays important roles in ceremonies and celebrations.",
      "funFact": "Karen weavers create incredibly intricate patterns on backstrap looms, with some complex designs taking months to complete - each pattern tells stories and represents clan identity!"
    },
    "history": {
      "origins": "Karen oral traditions speak of origins far to the north, possibly in the Gobi Desert or Mongolia, with migrations southward over millennia. Linguistic evidence suggests they arrived in mainland Southeast Asia over 2,000 years ago. They settled in the hills and mountains, developing swidden agriculture and maintaining relative autonomy from lowland kingdoms.",
      "colonialImpact": "British colonization of Burma (1824-1948) significantly impacted Karen communities. Christian missionaries converted many Karen, introducing literacy and Western education. During WWII, many Karen fought alongside Allied forces against Japanese occupation. Post-independence, Karen-Burmese relationships deteriorated into armed conflict.",
      "conflict": "Since 1949, various Karen groups have been in armed conflict with Myanmar's central government, seeking autonomy or independence. This has caused massive displacement, human rights abuses, and refugee flows to Thailand. The Karen National Union has led resistance efforts. Despite ceasefires, tensions remain.",
      "modernHistory": "Today, Karen communities exist in Myanmar, Thailand (including refugee camps), and diaspora worldwide. Many maintain traditional practices while adapting to modern circumstances. The struggle for Karen rights and cultural preservation continues amid ongoing political instability in Myanmar."
    },
    "culture": {
      "weaving": "Karen weaving is a highly developed art form. Women use backstrap looms to create intricate textiles with complex patterns in red, white, and black. Different Karen subgroups have distinct patterns. Weaving knowledge passes from mother to daughter. Traditional garments include tunics with elaborate borders and sashes that indicate marital status and clan affiliation.",
      "agriculture": "Karen practice rotational swidden agriculture, growing rice, vegetables, and fruits in mountain clearings. This requires sophisticated environmental knowledge about soil, seasons, and forest regeneration. Rice cultivation is central to Karen life, with ceremonies marking planting and harvest. Karen also maintain forest gardens with diverse crops.",
      "neckRings": "The Kayan (sometimes called 'long-neck Karen') women's brass neck coils are perhaps the most recognized Karen cultural practice, though only one subgroup practices this. Girls begin wearing coils around age 5, adding rings over years. Contrary to myth, coils don't elongate necks but compress collarbones and ribs. The practice's origins are debated - aesthetic ideals, protection, or cultural identity markers.",
      "socialStructure": "Traditional Karen society is relatively egalitarian. Villages are led by respected elders chosen for wisdom and fairness. Both men and women can become village headpersons. Extended families live together or in proximity. Marriage involves negotiation and exchange of goods. Divorce is permitted. Women maintain significant autonomy and property rights.",
      "religion": "Karen practice diverse religions. Traditional animism venerates spirits (bgha) inhabiting nature. Christianity (primarily Baptist) was introduced in the 19th century and is now practiced by many Karen. Some blend Christian and animist beliefs. Buddhism influences some groups. The Karen have a creation story featuring Y'wa (God) that some Christians see as proto-monotheism.",
      "musicAndCeremony": "Karen music features drums, gongs, bamboo instruments, and communal singing. Ceremonies mark agricultural cycles, life transitions, and community events. The don dance, performed in circles with rhythmic movements, celebrates harvests and unity. New Year celebrations feature traditional music, dancing, and feasting."
