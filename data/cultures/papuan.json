    "introduction": {"whoTheyAre": "The Papuan peoples are the indigenous inhabitants of New Guinea, the world's second-largest island. Papua New Guinea (PNG) is one of the most culturally diverse places on Earth, with over 800 languages spoken and hundreds of distinct ethnic groups. The terrain - from coastal lowlands to high mountain valleys - has created extraordinary isolation, allowing unique cultures to develop independently. Papuan groups include highland peoples like the Huli and Melpa, lowland river peoples like the Asmat, and coastal groups. They are renowned for elaborate body decoration, sophisticated tribal art, complex ceremonial systems, and deep spiritual connections to land.", "culturalIdentity": "Papuan cultures are incredibly diverse, but common themes include strong clan-based social organization, elaborate exchange systems (like Moka in highlands), animistic spiritual beliefs centered on ancestors and nature spirits, and complex initiation ceremonies marking transitions to adulthood. Body decoration using paint, feathers (especially bird of paradise), shells, and other natural materials creates spectacular displays during sing-sings (festivals). Traditional governance through big-men (leaders who earn status through generosity and oratory) contrasts with hereditary systems elsewhere. Many Papuans maintain traditional lifestyles in remote areas while others engage with modern economy.", "funFact": "Papua New Guinea has over 800 languages - about 12% of the world's total! Some villages just kilometers apart speak mutually unintelligible languages, making PNG the most linguistically diverse nation on Earth!"},
    "history": {"earlySettlement": "Humans reached New Guinea over 40,000 years ago, making it one of the earliest-settled regions outside Africa. Agriculture developed independently around 9,000 years ago in the highlands, with sophisticated systems of drainage and crop cultivation. Different regions developed distinct cultures in relative isolation due to extreme terrain.", "tribalSocieties": "Pre-contact New Guinea comprised thousands of small tribal groups, each with unique languages and customs. Warfare between groups was common, often ritualized. Trade networks connected coastal and highland regions, exchanging shells, salt, stone tools, and other goods. Headhunting and cannibalism were practiced by some groups.", "colonialContact": "Europeans first reached New Guinea in the 16th century but significant colonization came later. The island was divided between Netherlands (west), Germany (northeast), and Britain (southeast) in the late 19th century. Australia took control of German and British sections during WWI. Colonial rule brought missions, plantations, pacification campaigns, and suppression of traditional practices.", "independence": "Papua New Guinea gained independence in 1975, uniting diverse groups into one nation. West Papua (Western New Guinea) remains part of Indonesia, with ongoing independence movements. Post-independence PNG has struggled with nation-building, corruption, and integrating diverse peoples. Many remote areas remain minimally connected to central government."},
    "culture": {"diversity": "Papuan cultural diversity is staggering. Highland groups practice intensive sweet potato agriculture, elaborate compensation rituals, and competitive gift-giving. Lowland groups practice sago cultivation, fishing, and headhunting traditions (now ceased). Coastal peoples are seafarers and traders. Each group has unique languages, dress, ceremonies, and beliefs. Generalizing about 'Papuan culture' is nearly impossible.", "bodyDecoration": "Papuans excel at spectacular body decoration. Bird of paradise feathers, cassowary plumes, shells, pig tusks, and intricate face painting create stunning displays during sing-sings and ceremonies. Different groups have signature styles - Huli men's elaborate wigs decorated with feathers, Asmat's dramatic black and white patterns, Mount Hagen's use of bright colors.", "bigMenSystem": "Many Papuan societies are organized through big-men - leaders who achieve status through accumulated wealth, oratorical skill, and strategic gift-giving. Unlike hereditary chiefs, big-men must continually prove themselves. The Moka exchange system in highlands involves complex exchanges of pigs, shells, and other valuables, with big-men orchestrating elaborate ceremonies.", "artAndCarving": "Papuan peoples create sophisticated art including carved wooden sculptures (Asmat's bis poles honoring ancestors), elaborate masks used in ceremonies, decorated shields and weapons, and intricate body ornaments. Art serves spiritual and social functions, connecting living with ancestors and spirit worlds.", "initiationCeremonies": "Many Papuan groups have elaborate male initiation ceremonies marking transition to adulthood. These can involve months or years of seclusion, teaching of sacred knowledge, physical trials, and dramatic revelations. Initiation creates bonds among age cohorts and transmits cultural knowledge.", "spirituality": "Traditional Papuan beliefs are animistic, seeing spirits in natural features, ancestors continuing to influence the living, and the spirit world interpenetrating daily life. Sorcery beliefs are widespread. Cargo cults emerged during colonial contact, blending traditional beliefs with Christian elements and explaining European wealth.", "wantokSystem": "The wantok system (from Tok Pisin 'one talk' meaning speaking the same language) creates obligations of mutual support among clan members. This provides social security but can enable corruption when extended to government positions."},
