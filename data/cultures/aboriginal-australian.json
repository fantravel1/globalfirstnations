Comprising hundreds of distinct groups with unique languages, traditions, and territories, Aboriginal peoples developed sophisticated land management practices including fire-stick farming, complex kinship systems, and rich spiritual traditions centered on the Dreamtime—the creation period when ancestral beings shaped the land."}},
