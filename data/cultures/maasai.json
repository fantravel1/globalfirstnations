    "introduction": {
      "whoTheyAre": "The Maasai (also spelled Masai) are a Nilotic ethnic group inhabiting northern, central, and southern Kenya and northern Tanzania. They are among the most well-known indigenous peoples of East Africa due to their distinctive customs, traditional dress, and proximity to many of the region's game parks. Despite pressures of the modern world, the Maasai have largely maintained their traditional semi-nomadic pastoralist lifestyle, centered around cattle, which are considered sacred and form the backbone of their economy and culture.",

      "culturalIdentity": "The Maasai speak the Maa language, a member of the Nilotic language family related to Dinka and Nuer. Their society is organized into age-sets, with young men undergoing rites of passage to become warriors (morani), who traditionally protected the community and its livestock.",

      "funFact": "The Maasai are famous for their traditional jumping dance called 'adumu,' performed by warriors who compete to jump the highest!"
    },

    "history": {
      "origins": "According to oral tradition and archaeological evidence, the Maasai originated in the lower Nile Valley, north of Lake Turkana (Northwest Kenya), and began migrating southward around the 15th century.",

      "expansion": "By the 17th and 18th centuries, they had established themselves across the Great Rift Valley region. The Maasai reached their territorial zenith in the mid-19th century, controlling land from Dodoma in central Tanzania to Mount Marsabit in central Kenya.",

      "colonialImpact": "European colonization in the late 19th and early 20th centuries significantly reduced their territory through treaties and land seizures. The 1904 and 1911 Maasai Agreements forced them from their best grazing lands in the Rift Valley. Creation of national parks and game reserves further limited traditional grazing areas.",

      "modernHistory": "Today, the Maasai continue to navigate between traditional ways and modern demands, with many successfully blending both worlds."
    },

    "culture": {
      "pastoralLifestyle": "Cattle are central to Maasai life, representing wealth, social status, and spiritual connection. The Maasai traditionally measure wealth not in money but in cattle and children. A common Maasai greeting is 'Kasserian Ingera,' meaning 'How are your cattle?'",

      "traditionalDress": "The Maasai are instantly recognizable by their distinctive red cloth called 'shuka,' draped around their bodies. Red is their favorite color, symbolizing bravery, strength, and unity. Both men and women wear elaborate beadwork jewelry, with colors and patterns carrying specific meanings about age, social status, and marital status.",

      "ageSetSystem": "Maasai society is organized into age-sets that progress through life stages: Childhood (young boys and girls help with herding), Warriors/Morani (young men aged 15-30, responsible for protecting the community), Junior Elders (married men who make community decisions), and Senior Elders (wise leaders who resolve disputes and preserve traditions).",

      "ceremonies": "Important ceremonies mark life transitions including Eunoto (ceremony marking the transition from warrior to junior elder), marriage (involves elaborate negotiations and exchange of cattle), and Enkipaata (pre-circumcision ceremony for boys).",

      "diet": "The Maasai diet traditionally consists of milk (fresh or fermented), meat (eaten on special occasions), blood from cattle (mixed with milk), and increasingly vegetables and grains in modern times."
