    "introduction": {"whoTheyAre": "Fijians (iTaukei) are the indigenous Melanesian people of the Fiji archipelago, which comprises over 330 islands in the South Pacific. They represent about 57% of Fiji's population, with Indo-Fijians (descendants of Indian laborers) forming another large community. Fijians are renowned for their warrior traditions, vibrant cultural practices including the kava ceremony and meke (traditional dance), and strong communal village life. Despite colonial history and modern challenges, Fijians maintain proud cultural identity centered on tradition, Christianity, and connection to land.", "culturalIdentity": "Fijian culture emphasizes communal living (vanua - land, people, traditions), chiefly hierarchy, Christian faith, and respect for customs. Traditional society is organized into mataqali (clans) led by hereditary chiefs (turaga). The kava (yaqona) ceremony is central to social and ceremonial life. Meke performances combine dance, song, and storytelling. Warfare and cannibalism were historically practiced but ended in the 19th century with Christianization. Modern Fijians balance traditional customs with Christian values and contemporary life.", "funFact": "Fiji was historically known for fierce warriors and was one of the last Pacific regions practicing cannibalism - the last known case was in the 1860s! Today, Fijians are famous instead for their warmth and hospitality."},
    "history": {"origins": "Fijians are descended from Austronesian-speaking peoples who reached Fiji around 3,500 years ago, mixing with earlier Melanesian populations. This created Fiji's distinctive culture blending Melanesian and Polynesian elements. Ancient Fijians developed sophisticated pottery (Lapita culture), ocean navigation, and fortified villages.", "preContact": "Pre-contact Fiji was characterized by distinct tribal confederacies, frequent warfare, elaborate religious systems, and skilled craftsmanship. Chiefs held great power. Cannibalism was practiced, often as part of warfare and religious rituals. Inter-island trade networks connected Fiji with Tonga, Samoa, and other Pacific islands.", "colonialEra": "Europeans arrived in the early 17th century. Christian missionaries came in the 1830s, successfully converting most Fijians. Tribal warfare and cannibalism largely ended. Fiji became a British colony in 1874 under Chief Cakobau. The British brought Indian indentured laborers to work sugarcane plantations (1879-1916), fundamentally changing demographics. Colonial rule protected some traditional systems while exploiting resources.", "independence": "Fiji gained independence in 1970. Post-independence politics have been marked by ethnic tensions between iTaukei and Indo-Fijians, resulting in multiple coups (1987, 2000, 2006). Constitutional arrangements balancing indigenous rights with democratic principles remain contentious. The 2013 constitution removed ethnic-based voting."},
    "culture": {"kava": "The kava ceremony (yaqona) is the heart of Fijian social and ceremonial life. Kava is prepared from pounded yaqona root mixed with water, creating a mildly narcotic beverage. Formal ceremonies follow strict protocols with the tanoa (kava bowl), bilo (coconut shell cup), and specific clapping patterns. Kava marks welcomes, farewells, apologies, celebrations, and important decisions.", "chieflySystem": "Fijian society is organized hierarchically with hereditary chiefs (turaga) leading mataqali (clans) and vanua (larger territorial groups). Chiefs hold ceremonial authority and are shown great respect. The Great Council of Chiefs (abolished 2012, restored 2023) represents traditional leadership. Village decisions often involve chief consultation.", "meke": "Meke is traditional Fijian dance-drama combining choreographed movements, chants (vus), and drumming. Different meke types include vakamalolo (sitting dances), seasea (standing dances by men), and taralala (fan dances by women). Meke tells stories of history, legend, and daily life, preserving oral traditions.", "traditionalArts": "Fijians excel at various crafts including masi (tapa cloth made from mulberry bark painted with geometric designs), pottery (especially from Kadavu), wood carving (tanoa bowls, war clubs), and mat weaving. These arts serve utilitarian and ceremonial purposes.", "warriorTraditions": "Historically, Fijians were formidable warriors. Tribal warfare was common, with victors sometimes consuming enemies. Warriors used clubs (totokia), spears, and bows. War dances and chants (cibi) intimidated opponents. Rugby has become a modern outlet for warrior spirit.", "christianity": "About 64% of iTaukei are Methodist Christians, with others Catholic or other denominations. Christianity is deeply integrated with Fijian identity. Village life revolves around church activities. Traditional and Christian beliefs often blend.", "communalLife": "Fijian villages maintain strong communal structures. Land is held communally. Villagers share labor (solesolevaki) for projects. Extended families live together. Respect for elders and traditional protocols remains strong despite modernization."},
