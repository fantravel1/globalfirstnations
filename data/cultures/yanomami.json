Living in circular communal houses (shabonos), practicing slash-and-burn horticulture, and maintaining complex shamanic traditions, the Yanomami face ongoing threats from illegal gold mining, deforestation, and disease. Their situation highlights global conflicts between indigenous rights and resource extraction."}},
