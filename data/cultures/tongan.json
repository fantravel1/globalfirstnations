    "introduction": {"whoTheyAre": "Tongans are the indigenous Polynesian people of the Kingdom of Tonga, an archipelago of 169 islands in the South Pacific. Tonga is unique as the only remaining indigenous monarchy in Polynesia and one of the few Pacific nations never formally colonized. Tongans are renowned for their strong cultural identity, royal traditions, seafaring heritage, and the centrality of family and Christian faith in their society. The Tongan diaspora, particularly in New Zealand, Australia, and the United States, maintains strong cultural connections to the homeland.", "culturalIdentity": "Tongan culture emphasizes respect for authority (particularly the monarchy and chiefs), strong family bonds (kainga), and Christian values (primarily Wesleyan Methodist). The social system includes royalty, nobles, and commoners with specific cultural protocols. Kava drinking ceremonies mark important occasions. Tapa cloth making, traditional dance, and feast preparations are important cultural practices. Rugby has become a significant part of modern Tongan identity. Despite modernization and large-scale migration, Tongans maintain fierce pride in their heritage.", "funFact": "Tonga is home to some of the world's largest rugby players - many top rugby stars are of Tongan descent, and rugby is deeply intertwined with Tongan identity and masculinity!"},
    "history": {"origins": "Tongans are descended from Austronesian voyagers who settled the islands around 3,000 years ago. The Tu'i Tonga Empire emerged around 950 CE, becoming the most powerful Polynesian polity, with influence extending across much of the Pacific. Tonga developed sophisticated social hierarchies, monumental architecture, and advanced seafaring capabilities.", "europeanContact": "Europeans first encountered Tonga in 1616 (Dutch explorers), with Captain Cook visiting in 1773-77, dubbing them the 'Friendly Islands.' The 19th century brought Christian missionaries (Wesleyans arrived in 1797), who successfully converted most Tongans. King George Tupou I unified Tonga, established a constitutional monarchy (1875), and navigated European colonialism without losing sovereignty.", "modernKingdom": "Tonga became a British Protected State (1900-1970) while maintaining internal self-government. Independence was achieved in 1970. The monarchy evolved into a constitutional system with increasing democratic reforms. The 2006 pro-democracy riots sparked political changes. King Tupou V implemented democratic reforms in 2010, reducing royal power.", "diaspora": "Since the 1960s, massive Tongan emigration has occurred, particularly to New Zealand, Australia, and the United States. Remittances from the diaspora are crucial to Tonga's economy. Diaspora Tongans maintain strong cultural ties through churches, cultural organizations, and regular visits home."},
    "culture": {"monarchy": "The Tongan monarchy is central to national identity. The current monarch is King Tupou VI. Nobles hold hereditary titles and land. Commoners show respect through traditional protocols including bowing and specific language forms. Royal events like coronations and birthdays are major celebrations.", "kava": "Kava (kava root beverage) plays important ceremonial roles. The kava ceremony (taumafa kava) marks important occasions with specific protocols for preparation and serving based on social rank. Kava is shared among men in social and formal settings.", "tapaArts": "Tapa (bark cloth called ngatu in Tongan) making is a highly developed art. Women beat mulberry bark into thin sheets, then paint intricate geometric designs. Large ngatu pieces mark important occasions and gift exchanges. Other arts include weaving fine mats (kie hingoa), woodcarving, and traditional dance.", "feasting": "Elaborate feasts (pola) are central to Tongan social life, marking births, deaths, weddings, and other occasions. Pigs are roasted in earth ovens (umu). Root crops, fish, and other foods are displayed abundantly. Feasting demonstrates generosity and maintains social bonds.", "dance": "Traditional Tongan dance includes the seated tau'olunga (performed by unmarried women), the energetic kailao (performed by men with weapons), and various group dances. Dance preserves history and cultural values while providing entertainment.", "family": "Family (kainga) is the foundation of Tongan society. Extended families live together or nearby. Family members have specific obligations of mutual support. Respect for elders (faka'apa'apa) is paramount. Tongan culture emphasizes community over individualism.", "christianity": "Christianity is deeply integrated with Tongan identity. About 98% of Tongans are Christian, primarily Wesleyan Methodist. Sundays are sacred for church and family. Christian values blend with traditional customs. Churches are social and spiritual centers."},
