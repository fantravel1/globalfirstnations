    "introduction": {"whoTheyAre": "The Dayak are the indigenous peoples of Borneo, the world's third-largest island, comprising over 200 distinct ethnic subgroups including Iban, Bidayuh, Kayan, Kenyah, and others. They have inhabited Borneo's dense rainforests for thousands of years, developing sophisticated swidden agriculture, building impressive longhouses that house entire communities, and maintaining rich spiritual traditions connected to the forest. Historically known for headhunting practices (now ceased), elaborate tattoos, and skilled craftsmanship, the Dayak continue many traditional practices despite rapid modernization and deforestation.", "culturalIdentity": "Dayak culture emphasizes communal living in longhouses, respect for forest spirits, elaborate ceremonies, and intricate arts including beadwork, weaving, and woodcarving. Traditional Dayak religion is animistic, though many have converted to Christianity or Islam. Tattoos mark important life transitions and achievements. The Dayak have extensive traditional ecological knowledge of rainforest plants, animals, and sustainable resource use. Despite diversity among groups, shared cultural elements unite Dayak identity.", "funFact": "Traditional Dayak longhouses can be over 100 meters long and house entire villages of 100+ people under one roof, with each family having private quarters but sharing communal spaces!"},
    "history": {"origins": "Archaeological evidence suggests humans have inhabited Borneo for at least 40,000 years. The Dayak are descendants of Austronesian peoples who migrated to Borneo thousands of years ago, developing distinct cultures adapted to rainforest life. They established complex trade networks dealing in forest products, gold, and other goods.", "headhunting": "Historically, many Dayak groups practiced headhunting, taking enemy heads in warfare and raids. This practice had ritual significance - heads were believed to bring spiritual power and agricultural fertility. Headhunting declined in the 19th century under colonial pressure and largely ended by the mid-20th century, though isolated incidents occurred during Indonesian conflicts.", "colonialImpact": "Dutch and British colonial rule (19th-20th centuries) profoundly impacted Dayak societies. Colonizers suppressed headhunting, introduced Christianity, and exploited forest resources. Some Dayak groups resisted while others collaborated. Christian missionaries converted many Dayak, though traditional beliefs often persisted alongside Christianity.", "modernHistory": "Indonesian independence (1945) and Malaysian formation (1963) placed Dayak under different national governments. Massive deforestation for logging, palm oil, and mining has devastated Dayak lands. Conflicts with transmigrants and government policies marginalizing indigenous rights continue. Some Dayak have moved to cities while others fight to preserve traditional territories and ways of life."},
    "culture": {"longhouses": "The longhouse (rumah panjang in Indonesian) is the quintessential Dayak dwelling. These massive wooden structures on stilts house entire communities, with individual family apartments along a central corridor and communal verandahs for gatherings. Longhouses represent Dayak social organization and communal values. Some modern Dayak still live in longhouses, though many have transitioned to individual houses.", "swiddenAgriculture": "Dayak practice rotational swidden (slash-and-burn) agriculture in the rainforest. They clear small forest plots, burn vegetation, plant rice and other crops, then allow land to regenerate while farming new areas. This system, sustainable with traditional population levels, requires extensive environmental knowledge. Rice is the staple crop, with elaborate planting and harvest ceremonies.", "tattooing": "Traditional Dayak tattoos (pantang) cover hands, arms, legs, and other body parts with intricate designs. Tattoos mark achievements, social status, and life transitions. Women received hand tattoos, while warriors earned body tattoos for accomplishments including headhunting. Patterns vary by ethnic group and carry specific meanings. Tattooing traditions are being revived among younger Dayak.", "artisanship": "Dayak are skilled artisans. They create elaborate beadwork, intricate weavings, carved wooden masks and statues, ceremonial shields, and mandau (traditional swords). Hornbill feathers and beads adorn ceremonial costumes. These crafts serve both utilitarian and ritual purposes.", "spiritualBeliefs": "Traditional Dayak religion is animistic, believing spirits inhabit natural features, plants, and animals. Shamans mediate with spirit worlds. Ancestors are honored through ceremonies. Many rituals ensure agricultural success and community wellbeing. While many Dayak have converted to Christianity or Islam, traditional beliefs often blend with these religions.", "ceremonies": "Dayak celebrate numerous ceremonies including Gawai (harvest festival), funerary rites involving elaborate rituals and sometimes secondary burials, and transition ceremonies for births, coming-of-age, and marriages. These events feature dancing, music (including sape lute), feasting, and rice wine consumption."},
